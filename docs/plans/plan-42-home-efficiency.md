# Plan 42: Home Efficiency Program

## Overview

Deluge's flagship initiative: upgrading homes to be energy-efficient and capable of localized electricity generation, reducing strain on the power grid from the demand side.

The path to grid impact:

1. **Reduce consumption** — insulation, sealing, efficient windows
2. **Strengthen infrastructure** — roofs that can support solar, panels that can handle modern loads
3. **Generate locally** — solar panels on every upgraded home
4. **Grid impact** — less demand + distributed generation = a more resilient grid

This becomes Deluge's active Strategic Plan in the aquifer system. Each neighborhood batch is a flagship project under this plan.

## Program Structure

### Strategic Plan Integration

The Home Efficiency Initiative operates as a Strategic Plan within the existing aquifer system:

- **Title:** "Home Efficiency Initiative"
- **Funding sources:** Reserve fund (Deluge-directed) + Pool (community contributions) + user watershed contributions + corporate matching + grants
- **Flagship projects:** Each individual home phase or neighborhood batch is a flagship project under this plan

### Upgrade Categories

Every home assessment produces an upgrade plan covering up to 9 areas:

| Category | What It Covers | Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Insulation** | Attic, walls, basement/crawlspace, ductwork | Reduce heating/cooling loss 20-50% |
| **Air Sealing** | Weatherstripping, caulking, foam injection, duct sealing | Eliminate drafts, reduce HVAC load |
| **Doors** | Exterior door replacement, storm doors, sweeps, seals | Major air leakage point — often overlooked |
| **Windows** | Double/triple pane replacement, storm windows, film | Reduce thermal transfer, noise |
| **HVAC Systems** | Furnace, AC, heat pump upgrades | Old systems waste 30-40% of energy |
| **Water Heating** | Tankless or heat pump water heaters | ~20% of home energy use |
| **Electrical Panel** | Panel upgrade to support solar, EV charging, modern loads | Prerequisite for solar + future electrification |
| **Roof Reinforcement** | Structural upgrades to support solar panel weight + mounting | Enable solar installation |
| **Solar Installation** | Panels, inverter, wiring, meter connection | Generate electricity locally |

Not every home needs all 9. The assessment determines which upgrades apply and their priority order. General sequence: seal the envelope first (insulation, sealing, doors, windows), upgrade systems second (HVAC, water heating, electrical), then generate (roof, solar).

## How Homes Enter the Program

### Track 1: Individual Application

1. Homeowner applies through Deluge (new `/efficiency` page)
2. Basic intake: address, home type, age, current energy costs, ownership verification
3. Queued for assessment
4. Assessment produces upgrade plan + cost estimate
5. Home enters funding pipeline

### Track 2: Community Nomination

1. Community members nominate a home or neighbor (with permission)
2. Nomination goes through existing aquifer voting (Pool fund, 66% threshold)
3. Approved nominations enter assessment queue
4. Community gets visibility into the home they nominated

### Track 3: Neighborhood Batch (The Cascade)

The key innovation — economies of scale through geographic clustering:

1. Individual applications cluster geographically
2. When enough homes in a neighborhood reach funding threshold, a **Neighborhood Cascade** triggers
3. Bulk contractor pricing kicks in (economies of scale)
4. The entire neighborhood is upgraded as a single flagship project
5. Shared logistics, shared equipment, shared inspections

**Cascade threshold** (open question — to be determined based on early program data):
- Minimum number of homes in a geographic radius (e.g., 10 homes within 1 mile)
- Total funding allocated exceeding bulk pricing threshold
- Community vote to trigger the batch

## Eligibility & Funding Tracks

Three tracks to support different financial situations:

### A. Fully Funded (Low-Income)

- Household income below threshold (e.g., area median income)
- Program covers 100% of upgrade costs
- Funded from Reserve + Pool + user contributions
- No repayment obligation
- Verification: income documentation or participation in existing assistance programs (LIHEAP, Weatherization Assistance Program)

### B. Loan-Assisted

- Homeowner takes a Deluge microloan or watershed loan for some/all of the cost
- Standard loan terms apply: 0% interest, 2% servicing fee (microloans) or 1% origination fee on community-funded portion (watershed loans)
- Uses existing loan infrastructure (Tiers 1-5 or Watershed Loans)
- Energy savings offset loan payments (homeowner saves on utility bills)
- Builds credit through Deluge's credit bureau reporting (Plan 16)

### C. Co-Pay / Sliding Scale

- Homeowner pays a percentage based on income bracket
- Deluge covers the remainder
- Can combine with Track B (loan for homeowner's portion)

**Open questions:**
- How to verify income without creating barriers — partner with existing programs (LIHEAP, WAP) for eligibility data?
- Exact income thresholds for Track A vs Track C
- Sliding scale percentages per income bracket

## Assessment Pipeline

### Home Energy Assessment

Each accepted home gets an energy assessment:

1. **Data collection** — Square footage, year built, current insulation, window types, roof condition, current energy bills, HVAC system age and type
2. **Scoring** — Energy efficiency score (0-100) based on collected data
3. **Upgrade plan** — Which of the 9 categories apply, in priority order
4. **Cost estimate** — Per-category and total, based on local contractor rates
5. **Projected savings** — Estimated monthly/annual energy savings post-upgrade
6. **Solar potential** — Roof orientation, shading, estimated generation capacity

**Who performs the assessment:** TBD — Deluge staff, partner auditors, certified HERS raters, or self-assessment with verification. Left open for now.

### Phased Upgrades — Multiple Funding Rounds

A full upgrade across all 9 categories could cost $30K-$80K+ per home. Rather than requiring one massive funding round, each home's upgrade plan is broken into **phases** that can be funded and executed independently:

| Phase | Categories | Typical Cost Range | Why This Order |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Phase 1: Envelope | Insulation, Air Sealing, Doors | $3K-$10K | Biggest efficiency gain per dollar |
| Phase 2: Openings | Windows | $5K-$15K | Completes the thermal envelope |
| Phase 3: Systems | HVAC, Water Heating | $5K-$20K | Efficient systems in a sealed home = compounding savings |
| Phase 4: Electrical | Panel upgrade | $2K-$5K | Prerequisite for solar |
| Phase 5: Generation | Roof reinforcement, Solar | $15K-$35K | Largest cost, but home is now ready |

**How this works:**

- Each phase is its own fundable project within the home's overall upgrade plan
- A phase can be funded through any track (fully funded, loan, co-pay)
- Completing Phase 1 delivers immediate savings — the home doesn't wait for Phase 5
- Each completed phase updates the home's efficiency score and impact metrics
- Later phases unlock naturally as funding accumulates
- Neighborhood Cascades can trigger per-phase (e.g., 10 homes all need Phase 1 = bulk insulation contract)

**Home record tracks:** overall upgrade plan, which phases are complete, which are funded, which are pending. A home could sit at Phase 2 for months while funding builds for Phase 3 — and that's fine, because every phase delivers value.

```

### Gap Funding

Construction and upgrade costs frequently exceed initial estimates. The program handles this through gap funding:

- **Cost overrun detected:** Contractor reports actual cost exceeds estimate during or after work
- **Gap funding request:** A supplemental funding round is created for the difference, attached to the same home/phase project
- **Same funding sources:** Reserve, Pool, user contributions, matching, grants — all eligible
- **Transparency:** Original estimate, actual cost, and gap amount are all visible to contributors
- **Unused funds return to Pool:** If a phase comes in under budget or gap funds are raised beyond what's needed, the surplus flows back to the Aquifer Pool for the community to deploy elsewhere

## Future Phases

### Power Company Reconciliation

Noted for later design — not part of this plan. **Deluge is not a power company.** All power generation, distribution, and grid management remain with the local utility. Deluge's role is funding the upgrades — not operating the energy infrastructure.

Future coordination opportunities:
- Help homeowners navigate net metering enrollment with their local utility
- Provide upgrade data to utilities to help them plan grid improvements
- Partner with utilities on rebate programs (pass savings to homeowners)
- Share aggregate impact data (homes upgraded, estimated demand reduction) for public transparency

## Open Questions

These items are flagged for future decisions as the program develops:

1. **Cascade threshold** — What triggers a Neighborhood Cascade? Minimum home count, funding amount, community vote, or combination?
2. **Income verification** — How to verify eligibility for Track A (fully funded) without creating barriers?
3. **Sliding scale brackets** — What income brackets and corresponding co-pay percentages for Track C?
4. **Assessment providers** — Who performs home energy assessments? Deluge staff, partner auditors, HERS raters, or self-assessment?
5. **Contractor network** — How are contractors selected, vetted, and managed?
6. **Quality verification** — How is completed work verified before marking a phase complete?
7. **Geographic rollout** — Which markets launch first? How does the program expand?
