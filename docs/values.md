## What Deluge Believes

Generous people give until it hurts. Deluge makes giving sustainable -- multiple pathways to contribute (cash, ads, volunteering, business browsing, referrals), transparent tracking of where every cent goes, and a watershed model that recycles capital through microloans. The giving is the product. Sustainability is the design principle.

**Who it's for:** The person who donates to every GoFundMe and never knows where the money went. The person who volunteers 20 hours a week and wishes they could do more. Deluge competes with the fragmented, opaque world of informal community giving, not with GoFundMe or DonorsChoose.

**The on-ramp:** Not everyone has cash to give. The Deluge Impact tier ($25/month) includes a $10/month Deluge-funded watershed credit for users who want maximum impact. But the free tier is equally valid -- watching ads, browsing businesses, and volunteering all generate real project funding. Deluge works for people with money and people without it.

**The metaphor:** Individual drops become collective force. One by one, all at once. No single raindrop takes credit for the river.

## What Deluge Does and Doesn't Do

Deluge is infrastructure, not editorial. The platform verifies identity, legitimacy, and legality. The community decides what gets funded. Deluge doesn't pick winners.

### Deluge IS

- **Community-driven** -- the people decide what gets funded, not the platform
- **Accessible** -- start with $5, or $0 through ads, volunteering, and browsing
- **Transparent** -- see everything: where money goes, how it splits, what it funds
- **Engaging** -- game mechanics make giving fun
- **Bottom-up** -- anyone can propose, everyone can rally
- **Collective** -- together we are powerful

### Deluge is NOT

- A curator (we don't pick winners -- the community does)
- Charity (it's a platform, not a foundation)
- Just donating (you see real outcomes, track impact, fund microloans)
- Complicated (simple, beautiful, intuitive)
- Exclusive (everyone can participate)
- Preachy (invitation, not lecture)
- Top-down (no editorial board choosing which projects "deserve" funding)

## What Deluge Wants for Its Users

**Borrowers:** Build a track record that didn't exist before. Graduate from Deluge to conventional credit. "I built my credit score through Deluge" is the life-changing story.

**Funders:** Deploy impact capital that regenerates. See money turn into real outcomes. Participate in something bigger without going broke.

**Free-tier users:** A realistic on-ramp to meaningful participation through ads, referrals, community grants, and corporate matching. If Deluge only works for people with money, it fails its mission.

**Everyone:** Individual growth within collective progress.

## What Deluge Wants as a Business

**Structure:** Deluge Fund PBC (Public Benefit Corporation) -- for-profit with mission protection, partnered with 501(c)(3) nonprofits for impact projects. The hybrid structure ensures mission protection while enabling sustainable profit.

**Revenue priorities (in order):**

1. Subscriptions (primary)
2. Ad revenue and business card directory (secondary)
3. Corporate ESG partnerships (Year 2+)
4. B2B and corporate ESG programs (Year 2+)
5. Microloan servicing fees (Year 2+, modest)
6. Credit bureau reporting (Year 3+, cost center not revenue)

Microloans are not a revenue driver. The value is mission alignment, user engagement, and recycled impact capital.

## Platform Principles

### Reward Participation, Never Spending

Every gamification mechanic must pass one test: does this reward behavior that's good for the user and their community, or does it pressure them to spend more money?

**We reward:**

- Impact outcomes (what the money did, not how much was spent)
- Community participation (proposing, promoting, discussing, sharing)
- Consistency and habit (showing up regularly, regardless of amount)
- Individual growth within collective progress

**We never reward:**

- Dollar amounts contributed (no "$1K Club" or spending-based leaderboards)
- Competitive spending (no "contribute more than your friend" challenges)
- Individual hero moments that create FOMO or racing behavior
- Breadth of spending for completionism's sake

The deluge is made of drops, not whales. A user who contributes $5/month and watches ads to fund projects in their community is as valuable as someone contributing $500/month.

### No Individual Heroes

The cascade metaphor is about collective force. No single raindrop takes credit for the river. Celebrating one person as the "trigger" creates FOMO, incentivizes racing to be last, and undermines the "one by one, all at once" message. Every backer matters equally.

Leaderboards rank participation and impact, never dollar amounts. The person who contributes $5 and shares with 20 friends ranks higher than someone who quietly contributes $5,000.

### Verify, Don't Curate

Deluge verifies:

- The proposer is who they say they are
- The organization is legitimate
- The project is legal and within guidelines
- Funds can be tracked and reported on

Deluge does not judge:

- Whether the project is "good enough"
- Whether it will succeed
- Whether it's popular enough
- Whether it fits a specific category perfectly

## Loan System Principles

These principles govern every decision in the microloan system:

### 1. The Community Decides

Deluge verifies identity and legality. Funders decide what's worth funding. The borrower states their purpose and the community chooses whether to back it. Deluge's role is to confirm the person is real and the purpose is legal -- everything else is the community's call.

### 2. Consequences Are Proportional, Not Permanent

Credit halving after default recovery, not lifetime bans. A $25 minimum floor so nobody is permanently excluded. The path back always exists -- it just requires demonstrating renewed responsibility. People's circumstances change, and a default doesn't make someone permanently unworthy of a second chance.

### 3. Once Funded, Funding Is Permanent

No clawbacks, no vetoes, no re-funding on refinance. If a concurrent loan defaults, the other loan is unaffected. Refinancing adjusts terms without community re-approval. Funders accepted the risk at the point of funding -- the rules don't change retroactively.

### 4. Funders Should Expect Nothing

Repayment is a hopeful outcome, not a guarantee. Every disclosure reinforces this: "your $20 is unlikely to return," "this is the risk of microlending, and you accepted it when you funded this loan." Funders contribute to help another person grow. If the money comes back, that's the upside -- not the baseline expectation.

### 5. Flexibility Through Sponsorship

The one-loan-at-a-time rule has exceptions, but they cost reputation. Concurrent loan sponsorship uses halved power (higher risk). Sponsor-upward uses full power (same loan, lower risk). The system bends for people who need it, with natural checks built in.

### 6. Transparency Over Optimization

Show the share count, show the repayment progress, show the risk. Funders see their share repayment status and estimated timeline. Borrowers see their payment schedule and credit progression. Term limits are disclosed upfront. The math is never hidden.

### 7. Support Over Punishment

Refinancing exists to prevent default, not to generate revenue. Recovery exists to give people a second chance. Goal verification is trust-and-verify, not strict audit. The system is designed to help borrowers succeed, because a borrower who succeeds is better for everyone -- the borrower, the funders, the sponsors, and the platform.
