## Brand Positioning

### Deluge IS:

- **Community-driven** -- the people decide what gets funded, not the platform
- **Accessible** -- start with $1, or $0 through ads
- **Transparent** -- see everything
- **Engaging** -- game mechanics make giving fun
- **Bottom-up** -- anyone can propose, everyone can rally
- **Collective** -- together we are powerful

### Deluge is NOT:

- A curator (we don't pick winners -- the community does)
- Charity (it's a platform, not a foundation)
- Just donating (you see real outcomes, track impact, fund microloans)
- Complicated (simple, beautiful, intuitive)
- Exclusive (everyone can participate)
- Preachy (invitation, not lecture)
- Top-down (no editorial board choosing which projects "deserve" funding)

---

## Tone of Voice

### Powerful but not aggressive
Like water: patient, inevitable, unstoppable. Not shouting -- flowing.

### Poetic but not precious
Beautiful language grounded in reality. Literary without being flowery.

### Revolutionary but not angry
Transformative change through collective action. Hopeful disruption, not destructive.

### Inclusive but not preachy
Invitation to join something bigger. Not guilt-tripping or lecturing.
