# Marketing Strategy

## Core Messaging Framework

### Brand Promise

"Deluge is where communities come together to invest in what matters to them."

### Elevator Pitch

"Deluge is a platform where people invest as little as $5 to grow their wealth AND fund real projects proposed by their communities. Anyone can propose a project. The community rallies behind the ones they believe in. When enough people care, the money follows. It's like if Kickstarter and Acorns had a community-driven baby -- you build wealth, your community decides what gets funded, and everyone tracks the real-world results."

## Messaging Pillars

### Pillar 1: Accessibility -- "Everyone can be a raindrop"

| Key Message | Supporting Point |
|-------------|-----------------|
| $5 minimum investment, $0-12/mo subscription | Traditional ESG funds require $10K |
| No expertise required | Guided experience, simple choices |
| Simple, beautiful app | Intuitive design, zero learning curve |
| Instant impact | Your money works from day one |

### Pillar 2: Transparency -- "See exactly where every drop goes"

|-------------|-----------------|
| Real projects, real updates | Photos, videos, data from funded projects |
| Verified impact metrics | Third-party audited outcomes |

| Know exactly which school | Unlike vague "charity overhead mystery" |

### Pillar 3: Impact -- "Real returns, real change"

### Pillar 5: Zero Barrier -- "Can't invest money? Invest your time."

| Key Message | Supporting Point |

| Watch ads to earn real investment credit | No cash needed to start |
| Full transparency on ad economics | "You earned $0.009. Deluge kept $0.006." -- the opposite of exploitative |
| Everyone can participate | Not just people who can afford to invest cash |
| Daily habit, daily growth | 30 seconds of your time becomes real money in your portfolio |

### Pillar 6: Engagement -- "Investing that doesn't bore you to death"

## Campaign Concepts

### Launch Campaign: #BeTheRaindrop

**Concept:** Encourage early adopters to share their "drop moment" -- the decision to make their first investment in Deluge.

**Creative:**
- Video: close-up raindrop falling in slow motion
- Text overlay: "I'm a raindrop for [cause]"
- CTA: "Join the deluge. Download now."

**Channels:**

| Channel | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Instagram/TikTok | Short video (15-30 sec) |
| Twitter/X | Text + image |
| LinkedIn | Professional angle for ESG audience |
| Reddit | AMA + organic posts |

**Influencer strategy:**
- Micro-influencers (10K-100K followers)
- Aligned with causes (eco-activists, education advocates, tech leaders)
- Authentic, not celebrity endorsement
- Budget: $500-2K per post

**User-generated content:**
- Film yourself with actual rain
- "I'm a raindrop for education because..."
- Share your first investment screenshot
- Tag 3 friends to join

**Success metric:** 10,000 signups in first 30 days.

---

### Ongoing Campaign: Cascade Stories

**Concept:** Highlight projects that hit 100% funding. Every cascade is a story worth telling.

**Creative:**
- Before/after photos
- Video of the cascade celebration moment
- Testimonials from project leaders
- Stats on impact created

**Example:** "2,847 raindrops became a deluge. Last week, Lincoln Elementary School in Denver was fully funded. Here's what happens next..."

**Channels:** Email to all users, social media celebration, blog deep-dive, local news outreach.

**Frequency:** Every time a project is funded (target: 1/week at scale).

**Success metric:** 30% of users who see a cascade story make a new investment within 7 days.
