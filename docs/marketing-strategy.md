# Marketing Strategy

## Core Messaging Framework

### Brand Promise

"Deluge helps generous people give sustainably -- building their communities without wrecking themselves financially."

### Elevator Pitch

"Deluge is a platform for people who want to give back to their communities. Anyone can propose a project. The community rallies behind the ones they believe in. You can contribute with cash, by watching ads, browsing local businesses, or volunteering for community grants -- even with $0 to give. It's community-driven giving that actually works."

---

## Messaging Pillars

### Pillar 1: Accessibility -- "Everyone can be a raindrop"

| Key Message | Supporting Point |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Start with $5 cash, or $0 through ads, volunteering, and browsing | Traditional ESG funds require $10K; charity platforms assume you have money to give |
| No expertise required | Guided experience, simple choices |
| Simple, beautiful app | Intuitive design, zero learning curve |
| Multiple pathways to participate | Cash, ads, local business browsing, community grant volunteering, referrals |

### Pillar 2: Transparency -- "See exactly where every drop goes"

| Key Message | Supporting Point |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Real projects, real updates | Photos, videos, data from funded projects |
| Verified impact metrics | Third-party audited outcomes |
| No black boxes | Clear breakdown of every dollar |
| Know exactly which school | Unlike vague "charity overhead mystery" |

### Pillar 3: Sustainable Giving -- "Give without wrecking yourself"

| Key Message | Supporting Point |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Give what you can, when you can | $1 minimum cash contributions. No pressure to give more than you're comfortable with |
| Multiple free pathways | Can't give cash? Watch ads, browse businesses, volunteer. Zero-dollar impact is real impact |
| Watershed builds over time | Loan repayments recycle back -- your giving grows even when you stop adding |
| Proof, not promises | Stories and data from real outcomes |

### Pillar 4: Community -- "One by one, all at once"

| Key Message | Supporting Point |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Your community decides what gets funded | Not a platform committee -- the people choose |
| Anyone can propose a project | Low barrier to submit, community rallies behind the best ones |
| Together we are powerful | 100,000 raindrops = deluge |
| Find your tribe | Connect with people who care about what you care about |
| Celebrate cascades together | Shared victories when community projects fund |

### Pillar 5: Zero Barrier -- "Can't give money? Donate your attention."

| Key Message | Supporting Point |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Watch ads to fund real community projects | No cash needed to make an impact |
| Browse local businesses to fund your community | Discover what's in your neighborhood while funding projects with every view |
| Full transparency on ad economics | "$0.009 went to your project. Deluge kept $0.006." -- the opposite of exploitative |
| Volunteer for community grants | Complete real-world projects, earn watershed credit for your effort |
| Multiple pathways, one mission | Ads, business browsing, volunteering, referrals -- participate however works for you |

### Pillar 6: Engagement -- "Giving that doesn't bore you to death"

| Key Message | Supporting Point |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Game mechanics make it fun | Not "set and forget" |
| Achievements, challenges, leaderboards | Daily reasons to check in |
| Active, not passive | Compete with friends, unlock badges |
| Build habits | Recurring engagement loops |

### Pillar 7: Trust & Legitimacy -- "Real transparency. Real accountability."

| Key Message | Supporting Point |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Every cent accounted for | Full breakdown of where money goes, always visible |
| Verified nonprofits, vetted projects | Not a free-for-all. Every project is reviewed before funding begins |
| No hidden fees, no surprises | Flat subscription model. No per-transaction fees. No fine print. |
| We show you our economics | "Deluge kept $0.006. Your project got $0.009." -- we tell you what we make |

## Campaign Concepts

### Launch Campaign: #BeTheRaindrop

**Concept:** Encourage early adopters to share their "drop moment" -- the decision to make their first contribution on Deluge.

**Creative:**
- Video: close-up raindrop falling in slow motion
- Text overlay: "I'm a raindrop for [cause]"
- CTA: "Join the deluge. Download now."

**Channels:**

| Channel | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Instagram/TikTok | Short video (15-30 sec) |
| Twitter/X | Text + image |
| LinkedIn | Professional angle for ESG audience |
| Reddit | AMA + organic posts |

**Influencer strategy:**
- Micro-influencers (10K-100K followers)
- Aligned with causes (eco-activists, education advocates, tech leaders)
- Authentic, not celebrity endorsement
- Budget: $500-2K per post

**User-generated content:**
- Film yourself with actual rain
- "I'm a raindrop for education because..."
- Share your first contribution screenshot
- Tag 3 friends to join

**Success metric:** 10,000 signups in first 30 days.

---

### Ongoing Campaign: Cascade Stories

**Concept:** Highlight projects that hit 100% funding. Every cascade is a story worth telling.

**Creative:**
- Before/after photos
- Video of the cascade celebration moment
- Testimonials from project leaders
- Stats on impact created

**Example:** "2,847 raindrops became a deluge. Last week, Lincoln Elementary School in Denver was fully funded. Here's what happens next..."

**Channels:** Email to all users, social media celebration, blog deep-dive, local news outreach.

**Frequency:** Every time a project is funded (target: 1/week at scale).

**Success metric:** 30% of users who see a cascade story make a new contribution within 7 days.

---

### Ongoing Campaign: Community Grant Stories

**Concept:** Showcase completed community grant projects -- the before/after of real volunteer work in real neighborhoods. These are uniquely shareable because they feature actual people doing physical work, not just dollar amounts.

**Creative:**
- Before/after photos (overgrown lot → community garden, peeling walls → fresh mural)
- Short volunteer profile videos ("Meet Sarah. She spent Saturday building a lending library.")
- Time-lapse of project completion
- GPS-tagged location reveal ("This happened 3 blocks from you")

**Example:** "Last Saturday, 4 volunteers turned a vacant lot on Maple Street into a community garden. 12 families now have fresh produce. Zero dollars spent -- just time, effort, and a community that showed up."

**Channels:** Instagram Reels, TikTok (time-lapse format performs well), local community Facebook groups, Nextdoor, local news tip lines.

**Frequency:** 2-3x/week as grant volume grows.

**Success metric:** 15% of users who see a community grant story sign up for their first volunteer slot within 14 days.

---

### Ongoing Campaign: Local Business Spotlights

**Concept:** Feature local businesses in the Deluge directory -- who they are, what they do, and how browsing their card funds community projects. Dual purpose: recruit businesses to list and drive user browsing engagement.

**Creative:**
- "Meet [Business Name]" short profile (owner story, what they offer, which project they sponsor)
- Stats overlay: "47 people browsed [Business]. That funded $0.38 toward the Elm Street playground."
- Business owner testimonial: "I get discovered by my neighbors AND fund my community? Obviously."

**Market-by-market launch strategy:**
1. Seed 20-30 business listings per launch market before going live
2. Local PR push: "Deluge launches in [City] -- browse local businesses, fund local projects"
3. Business outreach via local chambers of commerce and small business associations
4. Cross-promote with community grant projects in the same neighborhood

**Channels:** Instagram (carousel of local businesses), Facebook (targeted local), Google My Business cross-promotion, local newsletter sponsorships.

**Frequency:** 1 business spotlight per market per week.

**Success metric:** 50% of users in a launch market browse at least one business card in their first week.

---

### Growth Campaign: Referral Program

**Concept:** Make referrals feel like community-building, not sales. The framing: "Every person you bring in is another raindrop. More raindrops = faster cascades = more projects funded."

**In-app referral prompts:**
- After first cascade participation: "You just helped fund a project. Know someone who'd want to be part of the next one?"
- After achievement unlock: "You earned [badge]. Challenge a friend to catch up."
- After community grant completion: "You showed up for your community. Who else would?"

**Share templates (pre-written, editable):**
- "I just helped fund a community garden through Deluge -- no money required. [link]"
- "I funded a community project through Deluge by watching a few ads. It took 5 minutes. [link]"
- "I volunteered through Deluge this weekend and earned credit toward a real project. [link]"

**Milestone celebrations:**
- 1 referral: "Your first raindrop joined the stream"
- 5 referrals: "You started a tributary"
- 25 referrals: "You're a force of nature"

**Channels:** Primarily in-app + organic social sharing. No paid promotion of the referral program itself.

**Success metric:** 20% of active users make at least one referral. 40% of referred users remain active at Day 30.

**Referral messaging alignment:** Referral credits vest in stages (signup: $0.50, first action: $1.00-1.50, Day 30 active: $1.00). In-app messaging should set expectations: "You'll earn credit as [Friend] hits milestones -- we'll notify you at each step." Don't promise the full $2.50-3.00 upfront. Show progress: "1 of 3 milestones reached."

---

### Ongoing Campaign: Microloan Success Stories (Year 2+)

**Concept:** Profile borrowers who used Deluge microloans to change their lives -- and the funders who made it possible. Microloans are the most emotionally compelling product Deluge offers: real money, real people, real outcomes, capital that comes back to fund the next person.

**Creative:**
- Borrower profile: who they are, what the loan funded, what changed
- Funder perspective: "I put $20 toward a stranger's business. She paid it back. Now it's funding someone else."
- Repayment celebration: "Loan fully repaid. $500 returned to the watershed. Ready to fund the next person."
- Credit-building angle: "She went from credit-invisible to a 640 score. It started with a $100 Deluge microloan."

**Example:** "Maria borrowed $500 through Deluge to buy equipment for her catering business. 25 funders, $20 each. She repaid in 8 months. That $500 is now funding a second loan for someone else."

**Channels:** Blog (deep-dive profiles), Instagram (borrower portrait + story carousel), LinkedIn (workforce development angle), local news (hometown success story), email to all funders.

**Frequency:** 1-2 borrower profiles per month once microloan volume supports it (Year 2+).

**Success metric:** 20% of users who see a microloan story deploy watershed capital to a microloan within 14 days.

---

### Ongoing Campaign: Achievement Challenges

**Concept:** Leverage the gamification system for marketing. Monthly or seasonal challenges that drive specific engagement behaviors and create shareable moments.

**Challenge types:**
- "7-Day Streak" -- watch at least one ad per day for 7 days
- "Community Explorer" -- browse 50 local business cards in a month
- "Cascade Contributor" -- contribute to 3 different projects in one week
- "Volunteer Badge" -- complete your first community grant
- "Raindrop Rally" -- refer 3 friends in one month

**Creative:**
- Challenge announcement post with countdown
- Mid-challenge leaderboard update
- Completion celebration with badge reveal
- Community stats: "4,200 people completed the 7-Day Streak this month"

**Channels:** In-app challenge center, Instagram Stories (daily updates), push notifications (challenge reminders), email (weekly challenge digest).

**Success metric:** 15% of MAU participate in at least one challenge per month. Challenge participants have 2x the 90-day retention rate of non-participants.

---

### Seasonal Campaign: Category Spotlights

Monthly focus on one impact category:

| Month | Category | Tie-in |
|-------|----------|--------|
| January | Health & Wellness | New Year resolutions |
| February | Arts & Culture | Black History Month |
| March | Innovation & Technology | SXSW |
| April | Environment | Earth Month |

**Tactics:** Featured projects, nonprofit spotlights, user stories, monthly challenge ("Can we fund 10 education projects this month?").

**Success metric:** 25% increase in category contributions during spotlight month.

## B2B / Corporate Marketing Strategy

Corporate ESG programs and impact matching funds are projected to generate $600K/year by Year 5. This requires a dedicated B2B go-to-market strategy separate from consumer marketing.

### Target Segments

| Segment | Company Size | ESG Maturity | Entry Product | Deal Size |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| B Corps & mission-driven companies | 50-500 employees | High -- already committed to impact | Impact Matching Fund | $10-25K |
| Mid-market companies with CSR programs | 500-5,000 employees | Medium -- has budget, needs direction | Employee Giving Program (white-label) | $15-50K |
| Enterprise ESG teams | 5,000+ employees | High -- needs measurable, reportable impact | White-label impact platform + matching funds | $50K+ |
| Local businesses (directory) | 1-50 employees | Low -- wants community visibility, not ESG reports | Free business card listing → premium upgrade | $0-15/month |

### B2B Messaging

**For corporate ESG buyers:**

"Your employees already want to give. Deluge gives them a platform to do it sustainably -- and gives you verified, reportable impact data. Match their attention. Amplify their contributions. Get real ESG metrics, not vague promises."

**For local businesses:**

"List your business for free. Your neighbors find you. Every view funds a local project. You get community impact credit for your storefront window. No ad budget required."

### B2B Campaigns

**Corporate outreach sequence:**
1. Cold email to CSR/sustainability leads: "What if your employee giving program funded verified local projects -- and you could prove it?"
2. Case study follow-up: "[Company X] matched $25K in ad-funded contributions. Here's what happened." (requires first corporate partner as proof point)
3. ROI comparison: "Traditional corporate volunteer day: $15K, 1 day of impact. Deluge Impact Matching Fund: $25K, 3.7 months of sustained community funding."

**Local business outreach sequence:**
1. In-person pitch at local business associations, chambers of commerce
2. "First 50 businesses in [City] get featured launch placement"
3. Dashboard demo: "See how many neighbors discovered your business this week"

### B2B Content

**LinkedIn (primary B2B channel):**
- Case studies from corporate matching campaigns
- ESG impact reports with verified data
- Thought leadership: "Why employee giving programs fail (and how to fix them)"
- Corporate partnership announcements

**Blog:**
- "How [Company] funded a school garden with ad matching"
- "Corporate ESG without the greenwashing: Deluge's approach"
- "The ROI of impact matching funds"

**Email (B2B-specific):**
- Quarterly impact reports to corporate partners
- New matching campaign opportunities
- Employee engagement metrics ("Your team watched 12,000 ads this quarter -- here's what they funded")

### B2B Sales Timeline

| Phase | Timing | Activity |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Proof of concept | Year 1 (late) | 1-2 local businesses as early partners. Document everything for case studies. |
| First corporate partner | Year 2 (Q1-Q2) | Target B Corps or mission-driven companies. Offer discounted matching fund to build the first case study. |
| Repeatable sales | Year 2 (Q3+) | Hire nonprofit/impact partnerships lead. Use case studies to pitch 3-5 additional corporate partners. |
| Scale | Year 3+ | Dedicated B2B sales role. Target mid-market and enterprise. |

**Critical dependency:** B2B marketing is pointless before the platform has consumer traction. Corporate partners need to see active users, real impact data, and proven engagement before they'll commit matching funds. Do not invest in B2B outreach before 10K+ consumer users.

## Pre-Launch Marketing (Phase 0 Support)

Phase 0 validation requires landing page traffic, survey responses, and community feedback. Marketing supports this with minimal budget ($200-500 allocated from Phase 0's $900-2,000 total).

### Landing Page Strategy

**Purpose:** Collect email signups and test messaging variants. Not a product launch -- a concept test.

**Page structure:**
1. Hero: strongest messaging variant from A/B test (see Phase 0 Validation Plan, Test 1)
2. Three-panel explainer: How it works (contribute → fund projects → track impact)
3. "Join the waitlist" email capture
4. Post-signup survey (5 questions: demographics, giving habits, price sensitivity, ad-watching willingness, referral willingness)

### Early Community Building

**Before the app exists:**
- Create a "Deluge Founders" email list from landing page signups
- Monthly update emails: "Here's what we're building and why"
- Invite top-engaged signups to a founding community (Discord, Slack, or email group)
- Founding community members get input on early product decisions (category naming, badge design, first community grant templates)
- "Founding Raindrop" badge reserved for users who signed up before launch

**Social media (pre-launch):**
- Instagram/TikTok: behind-the-scenes of building the platform
- Twitter/X: founder's journey thread ("Week 12 of building Deluge. This week: how we vet nonprofits. Here's what I learned.")
- LinkedIn: thought leadership on sustainable giving, community-driven impact
- Reddit: genuine engagement in r/SocialEntrepreneurship, r/personalfinance, r/startups

### Pre-Launch PR

**Pitch angle:** "Network security professional quits to build a community-driven giving platform."

**Target outlets for pre-launch:**
- Local news (founder's city)
- Startup publications (TechCrunch early-stage, Product Hunt upcoming)
- Impact/social enterprise publications
- Fintech newsletters and podcasts

**Timing:** Seed press 2-4 weeks before public Phase 0 landing page. Goal: drive organic traffic to the landing page during A/B testing to supplement paid traffic.

## Metrics & KPIs

### Consumer Metrics (Dashboard)

| Metric | Target (Year 1) | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| MAU / DAU ratio | > 30% | Measures daily engagement, not just monthly logins |
| 90-day retention | > 25% | Most apps lose 80% in 90 days. 25% is fintech-competitive. |
| Paid conversion rate | 8-12% | Revenue depends on this. Below 5% is a pricing problem. |
| Average contribution frequency | 2x/month | Measures habit formation. Below 1x/month signals disengagement. |
| Ad views per active user per day | 2-3 | Measures free-tier engagement. Below 1/day means the ad pathway isn't compelling. |
| Business card views per active user per day | 5-10 | Measures directory engagement. Low numbers mean insufficient local listings. |
| Cascade rate | 1/week at 50K users | Measures project funding velocity. Fewer cascades = less community energy. |
| Referral rate | 20% of active users refer at least 1 | Measures organic growth engine. Below 10% means referral program isn't working. |
| Community grant completion rate | > 70% | Measures volunteer follow-through. Below 50% means project scoping is wrong. |
| NPS | > 50 | Measures product-market fit. Below 30 signals a core experience problem. |

### Financial Health Metrics

| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Blended CAC | < $20 | > $25 means paid acquisition is unsustainable |
| LTV:CAC ratio | > 2:1 | < 1.5:1 means the unit economics don't close |
| Monthly churn (paid subscribers) | < 5% | > 8% means paid features aren't valued |
| Revenue per user (blended) | > $8/yr by Year 2 | < $5/yr means monetization is failing |
| Burn rate vs. projection | Within 20% | > 30% over projection means cost discipline has failed |

### Impact Metrics (Mission Health)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Total deployed to projects (cumulative) | $500K by Year 3 | Proves the platform creates real impact |
| Projects fully funded (cascades) | 50+ by Year 2 | Proves the community model works |
| Microloan repayment rate | > 85% | Below 80% signals vetting or support problems |
| Community grants completed | 100+ by Year 2 | Proves the sweat equity model works |
| Free-tier users who fund a project | > 40% within first 3 months | Proves the zero-dollar pathway delivers |

### B2B Metrics (Year 2+)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Corporate partners signed | 3-5 by end of Year 2 | Proves B2B product-market fit |
| Corporate matching fund utilization | > 60% of committed funds deployed | Below 40% means users aren't engaging with matched projects |
| Corporate partner renewal rate | > 70% | Below 50% means the impact report isn't compelling enough |
| Local business listings per active market | > 50 | Below 20 means the directory isn't useful enough to browse |
