# Executive Summary

## The Problem

The impact investing landscape is broken in several ways:

- **High barriers to entry** -- ESG funds require minimum investments of $10,000+, locking out most people
- **Lack of transparency** -- unclear where money goes and what impact is actually created
- **No engagement** -- set-it-and-forget-it platforms with no community or feedback loops
- **Fragmented landscape** -- different platforms for different causes, no unified experience
- **Exploitative models** -- some platforms take real money while delivering negligible value under deceptive framing

### What People Want

- To invest according to their values
- To see real, measurable impact from their money
- To start small ($5-25, not $10,000)
- To track both financial returns AND real-world outcomes
- To be part of something bigger than themselves

## The Solution

**Deluge** is a community-driven investment platform where people come together to fund the projects and causes they believe in.

### How It Works

1. **Invest as little as $5** per "parcel" -- money splits 85% into your investment portfolio, 15% into impact projects (adjustable on paid tiers)
2. **Communities form around causes** -- users find or create communities around what matters to them
3. **Anyone can propose a project** -- community members, nonprofits, and local organizations submit projects they want funded
4. **Communities promote what they believe in** -- members rally behind projects, share them, and build momentum
5. **Funding follows enthusiasm** -- when enough people care, the money follows. The community decides what gets built, not the platform
6. **Track everything** -- watch your wealth grow AND see the real-world outcomes of projects your community funded
7. **Watch ads to invest** -- can't invest cash? Watch ads to earn real investment credit
8. Platform costs covered by **flat monthly subscription** ($0-12/month, tiered like Acorns)

### The Role of Deluge

Deluge is **infrastructure, not editorial**. The platform provides:
- Investment rails (broker-dealer integration, portfolio management)
- Project verification (ensuring proposed projects are legitimate and impact is real)
- Community tools (discussion, promotion, voting, sharing)
- Impact reporting (tracking and verifying outcomes)

But the community decides what gets funded. Deluge doesn't pick winners -- the users do. If enough people rally behind a project, it gets funded. If not, it doesn't. The excitement is organic.

### The Vision

One by one, people join because something speaks to them. They find their community -- maybe it's local education, maybe it's clean energy, maybe it's their neighborhood park. They propose projects or rally behind someone else's. They share it. Others join. The momentum builds. Until suddenly -- all at once -- there is critical mass. The cascade happens. The project gets funded. Real change occurs.

This is what happens when you give ordinary people the tools to invest in what they care about and the community to amplify it.

## Market Opportunity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global ESG investing market | $35+ trillion, growing ~15% annually |
| Millennials wanting values-aligned investing | 70% |
| Robinhood users (proving low-barrier investing works) | 31M+ |
| DonorsChoose donors (proving people want specific impact) | 5M+ |
| Strava users (proving gamification drives retention) | 100M+ |

**No platform currently combines all three:** accessible investing + transparent impact + gamified engagement.

## Competitive Advantage

### vs. Traditional ESG Funds (Betterment, Wealthfront)

- Lower barrier ($5 vs $10K minimum)
- Transparent impact (specific projects vs vague ESG scores)
- Engaging experience (game mechanics vs static fund)

### vs. Investing Apps (Robinhood, Acorns)

- Impact component (values-aligned vs pure profit)
- Community-driven (collective action vs individual trading)
- Purpose beyond wealth (meaning vs just money)

### vs. Charity Platforms (DonorsChoose, Kiva, GoFundMe)

- Financial returns (wealth building vs pure charity)
- Sustainable model (ongoing investment vs one-time donation)
- Broader scope (7 categories vs narrow focus)

### The Unique Combination

Deluge brings together four proven models that no one else has unified:

- **Accessible investing** (like Acorns) -- start with $5
- **Transparent impact** (like DonorsChoose) -- see exactly where your money goes
- **Community-driven funding** (like Kickstarter) -- the crowd decides what gets funded, not the platform
- **Gamified engagement** (like Strava) -- achievements, leaderboards, social features

## Why Now

- **Post-COVID values shift** -- people want purpose, not just profit
- **Generational wealth transfer** -- $68 trillion moving to Millennials/Gen Z over 25 years
- **ESG momentum** -- corporate and regulatory push for measurable impact
- **Technology maturity** -- fintech APIs and robo-advisor infrastructure make this feasible now
- **Trust gap** -- exploitative models have created demand for legitimate, transparent alternatives

## Hardest Challenges (Honest Assessment)

- **Regulatory complexity** -- operating as both an investment platform and charitable giving platform creates multi-jurisdictional SEC, FINRA, and state-level compliance obligations. Legal costs alone could reach $100-500K before launch.
- **The 85/15 split tension** -- return-focused users lose 15% of compounding potential; impact-focused users may feel 15% isn't enough. The adjustable ratio on paid tiers helps, but the default split is the core product-market fit question.
- **Post-Robinhood scrutiny** -- SEC and Congress are actively examining gamification of investing. Deluge's gamification is designed around impact outcomes, community participation, and consistency -- never dollar amounts or competitive spending. No spending-based leaderboards, no dollar-threshold badges, no "invest more than your friend" mechanics. This is a deliberate design choice to stay on the right side of regulatory concern, but any gamification on a financial product will draw scrutiny regardless.
- **Customer acquisition cost** -- fintech CAC averages $20-50/user. Deluge must build organic channels (referrals, PR, content) to survive, because paid-only acquisition will not work at early scale.
- **Project quality at scale** -- a community-driven model means anyone can propose projects. Deluge must verify legitimacy and track impact without becoming a bottleneck. Too much curation kills the community energy; too little invites fraud. Finding the right balance is critical.
- **Community moderation** -- user-driven platforms inevitably face moderation challenges. What projects are allowed? Who decides? How do you prevent the platform from being used to fund things that damage the brand?

## Business Model Summary

**Revenue streams:**

| Stream | Description | When |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Tiered subscriptions | $0/3/5/12 per month (Acorns model) | Day 1 |
| Ad revenue | Platform keeps 40% of ad revenue; 60% credited to users as investment | Day 1 |
| Management fees | 0.25-0.5% of AUM annually | Day 1 |
| Corporate ESG programs | White-label solutions ($10-50K/year) | Year 2+ |
| Project-side revenue | Success fees, loan repayments | Year 3+ (speculative) |

**Ad-funded investments:** Users who can't invest cash can watch video ads to earn real investment credit. "Can't invest money? Invest your time." This makes the platform accessible to anyone while generating platform revenue. Conservative eCPM: $0.008-0.025/view. Deluge keeps 40%, credits 60% to the user's account at their chosen split ratio.

**Path to profitability (base scenario):** Profitability around Year 4 with ~150K users. Requires approximately $1-1.3M in total capital to reach that point. This is not a small-budget bootstrappable business -- it is a venture-scale fintech product with significant regulatory costs.

**Key economic risk:** At conservative estimates for customer acquisition cost ($15-25/user), paid acquisition alone does not produce a viable LTV:CAC ratio. Deluge must achieve strong organic growth through referrals, content marketing, and PR to survive.
