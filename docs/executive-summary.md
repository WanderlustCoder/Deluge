# Executive Summary

## The Problem

People naturally want to collaborate and contribute, but they face connected problems:

- **No way to find what needs doing** -- coordination is fragmented. If you care about education in your city, your options are: donate to a big nonprofit (no idea where it goes), find a random GoFundMe (no vetting), volunteer your time (limited scale), or do nothing (most common outcome).
- **No mechanism for collective action** -- people care about the same things but can't find each other. A thousand people in Denver who care about youth education have no way to pool their energy and resources into something real.
- **High barriers to giving** -- charity platforms take money but offer no transparency. People who can't give cash are locked out entirely. No platform lets you contribute meaningfully with $0.
- **Exploitative models** -- some platforms take real money while delivering negligible value under deceptive framing. Others pressure users to give more than they can afford.
- **No feedback loop** -- you give money and never hear what happened. Did the school get built? Did the garden survive? Donors are left to wonder.

### What People Actually Need

- To see real, measurable impact from their contributions
- To start small ($1-25) -- or with $0 if that's what they have
- To find verified projects in their community and see what others are backing
- To be part of something bigger than themselves
- To give without getting exploited

---

## The Solution

**Deluge** is a community-driven giving platform. Communities come together to find, fund, and celebrate the projects and causes they believe in. Anyone can propose a project. The community rallies behind the ones that matter. When enough people care, the money follows.

### How It Works

1. **Find your community** -- users discover or create communities around what matters to them (education, environment, local projects, innovation)
2. **Anyone can propose a project** -- community members, nonprofits, local organizations, and individuals submit projects they want funded. Volunteers can pick up community grant projects for watershed credit.
3. **Communities rally behind what they believe in** -- members promote projects, share them, and build momentum. When enough people care, the funding follows.
4. **Contribute in the way that works for you:**
   - **Give cash** ($1 minimum) -- fund the projects you believe in directly
   - **Watch ads** -- donate your attention to fund projects with $0 out of pocket
   - **Browse local businesses** -- every view of a community business card funds projects in your area
   - **Volunteer** -- complete community grant projects and earn watershed credit for your effort
   - **Refer friends** -- earn watershed credit for every friend who joins and stays active
5. **Track everything** -- see exactly where every dollar and every ad view goes, with real-world outcome reporting from funded projects
6. Platform costs covered by **flat monthly subscription** ($0-12/month, tiered) and ad revenue

### The Role of Deluge

Deluge is **infrastructure, not editorial**. The platform provides:
- Project verification (ensuring proposed projects are legitimate and impact is real)
- Community tools (discussion, promotion, voting, sharing)
- Impact reporting (tracking and verifying outcomes)
- A local business directory where browsing funds community projects
- Multiple contribution pathways (cash, attention, volunteering)

But the community decides what gets funded. Deluge doesn't pick winners -- the users do. If enough people rally behind a project, it gets funded. If not, it doesn't. The excitement is organic.

### The Vision

One by one, people join because something speaks to them. They find their community -- maybe it's local education, maybe it's clean energy, maybe it's their neighborhood park. They propose projects or rally behind someone else's. They volunteer for community grants. They share. Others join. The momentum builds. Until suddenly -- all at once -- there is critical mass. The cascade happens. The project gets funded. Real change occurs.

This is what happens when you give people a transparent way to give and a community to amplify it.

**Deluge: One by One, All at Once.**

## Market Opportunity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual US charitable giving | $500+ billion |
| GoFundMe campaigns created annually | 100M+ |
| DonorsChoose donors (proving people want specific impact) | 5M+ |
| Strava users (proving gamification drives retention) | 100M+ |
| Millennials/Gen Z who want to give but don't know where | ~60% |
| Kickstarter backers (proving community-driven funding works) | 22M+ |

**No platform currently combines:** transparent community giving + multiple contribution pathways (cash and attention) + gamified engagement + local business integration.

---

## Competitive Advantage

### vs. Charity Platforms (DonorsChoose, Kiva, GoFundMe)

- Multiple participation pathways -- cash, ads, volunteering, browsing (not just cash)
- Community-driven discovery (the crowd decides, not the platform)
- Broader scope (7 categories vs narrow focus)
- Free-tier users can participate meaningfully without spending a dollar
- Gamified engagement drives repeat participation, not one-time donations
- Local business directory creates a unique giving-while-browsing experience

### vs. Crowdfunding (Kickstarter, Indiegogo)

- Impact-focused, not product-focused
- Ongoing community engagement, not one-time campaigns
- Free-tier participation (no cash required)
- Verified impact reporting (not just "we shipped the product")

### vs. Community Platforms (Nextdoor, Facebook Groups)

- Built-in funding mechanism -- discussion leads to action, not just conversation
- Project verification and impact tracking
- Multiple contribution pathways including attention-funded giving
- Gamification and cascade mechanics drive sustained engagement

### vs. Doing Nothing (The Real Competition)

Most people who want to help their community end up doing nothing because the options are overwhelming, opaque, or require more money than they have. Deluge's real competition is inaction. The value proposition: "Find what needs doing. Fund it with whatever you have -- even $0. See exactly what happened."

### The Unique Combination

Deluge brings together four proven models that no one else has unified:

- **Transparent impact** (like DonorsChoose) -- see exactly where your money goes
- **Community-driven funding** (like Kickstarter) -- the crowd decides what gets funded, not the platform
- **Gamified engagement** (like Strava) -- achievements, leaderboards, social features
- **Attention-funded giving** (novel) -- watch ads, browse businesses, volunteer -- contribute with $0
- **Local business discovery** -- browse community businesses, fund projects with every view

---

## Why Now

- **Post-COVID values shift** -- people want purpose and community connection
- **Trust gap** -- exploitative models and opaque charities have created demand for legitimate, transparent alternatives
- **Attention economy maturity** -- ad-funded models are well-understood and technically feasible. Turning attention into community impact is a new application.
- **Local-first movement** -- growing interest in supporting local businesses, local projects, local communities
- **Creator/proposer culture** -- people are accustomed to proposing and backing things (Kickstarter, GoFundMe, Patreon). Deluge applies this to community impact.

## Hardest Challenges (Honest Assessment)

- **Customer acquisition cost** -- community platform CAC varies widely ($5-30/user). Deluge must build organic channels (referrals, PR, content) to survive, because paid-only acquisition will not work at early scale.
- **Project quality at scale** -- a community-driven model means anyone can propose projects. Deluge must verify legitimacy and track impact without becoming a bottleneck. Too much curation kills the community energy; too little invites fraud. Finding the right balance is critical.
- **Community moderation** -- user-driven platforms inevitably face moderation challenges. What projects are allowed? Who decides? How do you prevent the platform from being used to fund things that damage the brand?
- **Two-sided marketplace dynamics** -- community grants require both proposers and volunteers. Local business cards require both businesses and browsers. Building both sides simultaneously in each market is hard.
- **Regulatory classification** -- how user contributions and watershed credits are legally classified (donations, money transmission, or platform credits) determines the regulatory burden. The classification is the single most important legal question.
- **Ad revenue dependency** -- free-tier participation depends on sustainable ad eCPM rates. If ad rates drop, the zero-dollar pathway weakens. This is supplementary revenue but critical to the "everyone can participate" promise.
- **Proving impact** -- "third-party audited outcomes" is easy to say and hard to do at scale. Building a credible impact verification pipeline is an operational challenge that grows with every funded project.

## Legal & Compliance Roadmap

Without an investment/brokerage component, Deluge's regulatory landscape is dramatically simpler. No SEC registration, no FINRA oversight, no broker-dealer partnerships, no state securities filings. The remaining regulatory questions center on money movement and charitable classification.

### Regulatory Domains

| Domain | Governing Bodies | What It Covers | Launch Blocker? |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Money transmission | FinCEN, state regulators | Movement of funds (user contributions to projects, watershed credits, microloan disbursements) | **Likely yes** -- depends on structure |
| Charitable solicitation | State attorneys general (varies by state) | Soliciting donations for projects, if contributions are classified as "donations" | **Maybe** -- depends on legal classification |
| Consumer data / privacy | FTC, state privacy laws (CCPA, etc.) | User data, location data (GPS from community grants) | **No** -- not a launch blocker, but must be compliant from Day 1 |
| Microloan regulation | State lending laws, CFPB | Microloan origination, servicing, collection | **Yes for microloans** -- can defer microloans to Year 2 |

### Phase 1: Entity Formation & Legal Structure (Months 1-3)

| Task | Detail | Cost Estimate | Blocking? |
|------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Engage attorney | Experienced in crowdfunding, charitable platforms, or money transmission. Does not need to be a securities attorney. | $5-15K retainer | Yes |
| Determine entity structure | LLC, C-Corp, or nonprofit hybrid. Attorney advises based on fundraising plans and tax implications. | Included in retainer | Yes |
| Classify user contributions | Are contributions to projects "donations," "purchases," or "directed platform credits"? This determines which charitable solicitation rules apply. | Included in retainer | Yes -- foundational legal question |
| Classify watershed credits | Are referral credits, volunteer credits, and ad contributions "money," "points," or "platform credits"? Money transmission laws may apply. | Included in retainer | Yes |
| Entity formation | State filing, operating agreements, EIN, bank accounts. | $2-5K | Yes |
| **Phase 1 total** | | **$7-20K** | |

### Phase 2: State Compliance (Months 2-5)

| Task | Detail | Cost Estimate | Blocking? |
|------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Money transmitter analysis | If fund movement is classified as money transmission, licenses may be required per state. Mitigation: use a licensed payment processor (Stripe, PayPal) as the money movement layer so Deluge is not the transmitter. | $0-10K (analysis) or $50-200K (if licenses required) | Potentially -- Stripe/PayPal mitigation usually resolves this |
| Charitable solicitation registration | If contributions are classified as donations, registration required in ~40 states. | $10-25K if required | Only if classified as donations |
| Payment processing integration | Stripe, PayPal, or equivalent for handling user payments. These processors handle PCI compliance and fund custody. | $2-5K (integration cost) | Yes |
| Privacy policy & terms of service | CCPA compliance, GPS data policies (community grants), ad tracking disclosure. | $3-8K (legal drafting) | Yes |
| **Phase 2 total** | | **$15-48K** (or up to $240K if MTL required -- unlikely with Stripe/PayPal) | |

### Phase 3: Microloan Compliance (Year 2, deferred)

Microloans add regulatory complexity. By deferring to Year 2, Deluge can launch with grants-only and add microloans once the platform has traction and legal counsel has time to prepare.

| Task | Detail | Cost Estimate |
|------|--------|---------------|
| State lending law review | Microloan origination requirements vary by state. Some states exempt small community loans; others require lending licenses. | $10-20K |
| Lending license (if required) | Some states require a lending license even for 0% interest community microloans. | $5-25K per state |
| CFPB compliance review | Federal consumer lending regulations may apply depending on loan volume and structure. | Included in legal retainer |
| Credit bureau reporting (Year 3+) | Metro 2 format, FCRA compliance. See business model for full $75-120K roadmap. | Deferred |

### Total Legal & Compliance Cost Summary

| Phase | Cost Range | Timing | Deferrable? |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 1: Entity & structure | $7-20K | Months 1-3 | No |
| Phase 2: State compliance | $15-48K | Months 2-5 | Partially (phased state launch) |
| Phase 3: Microloan compliance | $15-45K | Year 2 | Yes -- launch without microloans |
| Ongoing (Year 1) | $10-25K | Post-launch | No |
| **Total pre-launch** | **$22-68K** | | |
| **Total Year 1 (including ongoing)** | **$32-93K** | | |

**Comparison to previous model:** The investment-platform version estimated $107-230K in Year 1 legal costs. Without securities regulation, the estimate drops to $32-93K -- a savings of $75-140K. This alone reduces total capital needed by 10-15%.

**The money transmitter question remains the biggest wildcard.** If Deluge uses Stripe or PayPal as the payment processing layer, those platforms hold the money transmitter licenses -- Deluge is using their infrastructure, not transmitting money itself. This is the standard mitigation for platforms like Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and DonorsChoose. Legal counsel should confirm this applies to Deluge's specific fund flow.

## Business Model Summary

**Revenue streams:**

| Stream | Description | When |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Tiered subscriptions | $0/3/7/12 per month | Day 1 |
| Ad revenue | Platform keeps 40% of ad revenue; 60% goes directly to community projects | Day 1 |
| Corporate ESG programs | Impact matching funds, white-label solutions ($10-50K/year) | Year 2+ |
| Microloan servicing fees | 2% of scheduled payments | Year 2+ (when microloans launch) |

**Ad-funded impact:** Users can watch video ads or browse local business cards to fund community projects directly. "Can't give cash? Donate your attention instead." Video ads: $0.008-0.025/view. Business card views: $0.001-0.003/view (higher volume). Deluge keeps 40%, remaining 60% goes directly to the user's chosen impact project. Corporate matching funds can amplify ad contributions up to 10x during campaigns.

**Free-tier pathways:** Referral credits, community grant volunteering, and corporate ad matching give free-tier users realistic earning potential of $13-31/month in watershed capital -- enough to fund a microloan contribution within the first month.

**Path to profitability (base scenario):** With dramatically lower legal and engineering costs, profitability is achievable around Year 3-4 with ~100-150K users. Total capital needed drops to approximately $400-700K.

**Key economic risk:** Subscription conversion. If users won't pay $3-12/month for a giving platform, the model needs to lean harder on ad revenue and corporate partnerships. Subscription value must be clearly differentiated from the free tier.

## Team & Staffing Plan

### Founder Brings

- Technical capability (infrastructure, security, systems thinking)
- Product vision and market insight
- Purpose-driven leadership

### Critical Gaps

- Legal expertise (crowdfunding, charitable platforms, money transmission)
- Nonprofit relationships and partnerships
- Marketing/growth leadership

### Phased Staffing Plan

Without the investment/brokerage side, Deluge no longer requires a fintech-experienced technical co-founder. A strong full-stack engineer can build the platform. This is a significant hiring simplification.

#### Phase 0 -- Validation (Pre-funding, 0 hires)

| Role | Who | Focus |
|------|-----|-------|
| Founder (sole operator) | Founder | Landing page, A/B tests, surveys, community interest validation |

No hires. Phase 0 costs under $2,000. See [Phase 0 Validation Plan](business-model.md#phase-0-validation-plan) for details.

#### Phase 1 -- Legal & MVP Build (Post-validation, 1-2 hires)

| Role | Type | Focus | Cost Estimate |
|------|------|-------|---------------|
| Attorney | Contract / retainer | Entity formation, contribution classification, state compliance | $7-20K (legal fees) |
| Lead engineer | Full-time (equity-heavy) or senior contract | Backend architecture, payment processing integration, community features | Critical hire |
| Founder | Full-time | Product, design, frontend, community building | Equity only |

**Milestone trigger:** Phase 0 validation passes.

Without broker-dealer integration, the MVP is buildable by a two-person engineering team (founder + one engineer). The lead engineer needs experience with payment processing (Stripe), real-time applications, and mobile development -- but does not need fintech or securities experience.

#### Phase 2 -- Launch & Early Growth (0-8K users, 2-3 FTE)

| Role | Type | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| Founder | Full-time | Product, strategy, community, moderation |
| Lead engineer | Full-time | Engineering, infrastructure, ad platform |
| Growth / marketing lead | Full-time | Content marketing, social media, PR, referral program |

**Milestone trigger:** MVP launched, first users onboarded.

The founder handles moderation, project verification, and community management at this stage. This is sustainable longer than in the investment-platform model because there's no brokerage operations overhead.

#### Phase 3 -- Growth (8K-75K users, 6-8 FTE)

| Role | Type | Focus | Trigger |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| 1-2 additional engineers | Full-time | Business card directory, community grants, mobile performance, microloan system | > 10K users |
| Dedicated moderator | Full-time | Project verification, content moderation, community grant oversight | > 10K users |
| Operations | Full-time | Subscription billing, ad revenue reconciliation, reporting | > 20K users or first B2B client |
| Nonprofit / impact partnerships | Full-time | Project sourcing, nonprofit relationships, impact verification, corporate ESG sales | > 30K users |

#### Phase 4 -- Scale (75K-250K users, 12-16 FTE)

| Role | Type | Focus | Trigger |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| Engineering team (2-3 more) | Full-time | Scaling, microloan system, credit bureau integration, data pipeline | > 75K users |
| Moderation team (2-3 more) | Full-time | Trust & safety team with lead | > 50K users |
| Data / analytics | Full-time | Impact measurement, user analytics, ad optimization | > 75K users |
| Customer support (1-2) | Full-time | User issues, billing, account management | > 100K users |
| B2B sales | Full-time | Corporate ESG programs, impact matching fund sales | > 5 corporate clients |

### Organizational Structure

At 12-16 FTE (Year 4-5 target):

| Function | Head | Team Size | Scope |
|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| Product & Engineering | Lead engineer / CTO | 5-7 | App development, infrastructure, data |
| Growth & Marketing | Head of Growth | 2-3 | Content, social, referrals, PR, community launches |
| Trust & Impact | Head of Impact (or founder) | 3-5 | Moderation, project verification, nonprofit partnerships, corporate ESG, impact measurement |
| Operations | Head of Ops | 1-2 | Finance, compliance, support |

### Key Differences from Investment-Platform Model

| Factor | Investment-Platform Model | Giving-Only Model |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Technical co-founder | Required (fintech experience) | Not required (strong full-stack engineer sufficient) |
| Legal costs (Year 1) | $107-230K | $32-93K |
| Total capital to profitability | $0.9-1.2M | $400-700K |
| Team size at scale | 15-20 FTE | 12-16 FTE |
| Time to MVP | 6-9 months | 3-5 months |
| Regulatory complexity | High (SEC, FINRA, state securities, money transmission) | Moderate (money transmission, charitable solicitation) |
| Hiring difficulty | High (fintech talent is expensive and scarce) | Moderate (community platform talent is more available) |
