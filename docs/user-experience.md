### Flow 1: New User Onboarding

**Objective:** Convert visitor to first investment in under 5 minutes.

**Steps:**

1. **Landing page**
   - Hero: "Deluge: One by One, All at Once"
   - Value prop: "Invest in what your community cares about."
   - CTA: "Join the deluge"

2. **Sign-up**
   - Email or social login
   - 30 seconds max

3. **Onboarding screens (4 slides)**
   - Slide 1: Raindrop animation -- "Every movement starts with one person"
   - Slide 2: Community forming -- "Find your people. Fund what matters."
   - Slide 3: River flowing -- "Together they've deployed $X to real projects"
   - Slide 4: Cascade -- "Welcome to the deluge"

4. **Find your community**
   - Browse trending communities and projects

   - Navigate to dashboard

**Success metric:** 50%+ conversion from landing page to first investment.

---

### Flow 2: Propose a Project

**Objective:** Enable community members, nonprofits, and local organizations to submit projects for funding.

This is the core differentiator. Deluge doesn't decide what gets funded -- the community does. Anyone can propose; the crowd decides.

**Who can propose:**
- Individual community members (with verification)
- Registered nonprofits (501(c)(3) -- fast-tracked verification)
- Local organizations (schools, community groups, churches)
- Small businesses (for workforce/innovation projects)

**Proposal steps:**

1. **Start a project**
   - Title and description
   - Category tags (not limited to one -- a project can be "education" + "local" + "youth")
   - Location (city, state, or "national/global")
   - Funding goal and timeline

2. **Add details**
   - What the money will fund (specific, measurable)
   - Impact metrics: "How will you measure success?"
   - Media: photos, video, documents
   - Organization details (if applicable)

3. **Verification queue**
   - Deluge reviews for legitimacy (not quality or popularity -- that's the community's job)
   - Verification checklist:
     - Is the proposer real? (identity verification)
     - Is the organization legitimate? (501(c)(3) check, business registration)
     - Is the project legal and within platform guidelines?
     - Are the funds traceable? (bank account verification)
   - Target: 48-72 hour review for most proposals
   - Nonprofits with GuideStar verification: fast-tracked (24 hours)

4. **Go live**
   - Project appears on platform
   - Proposer shares with their network
   - Community discovers, promotes, and funds it organically

**What Deluge does NOT judge:**
- Whether the project is "good enough"
- Whether it will succeed
- Whether it's popular enough
- Whether it fits a specific category perfectly

**What Deluge DOES verify:**
- The proposer is who they say they are
- The organization is legitimate
- The project is legal and within guidelines
- Funds can be tracked and reported on

**Success metric:** Average time from proposal to live < 72 hours. 20%+ of active users have proposed or promoted a project.

---

### Flow 3: Community Promotion & Momentum

**Objective:** Let communities organically surface the projects they care about. Funding follows enthusiasm.

**How projects gain momentum:**

1. **Sharing** -- users share projects to their networks (social media, email, in-app)
2. **Backing** -- users invest in a project, which shows commitment
3. **Promoting** -- users "boost" a project within the platform (similar to an upvote, but backed by their investment)
4. **Rallying** -- users create "rally" campaigns: "Can we get 100 people behind this by Friday?"

**Momentum indicators (visible on every project):**

| Indicator | What It Shows |
|-----------|---------------|
| Backer count | "347 people have invested in this project" |
| Funding progress | Water-fill progress bar toward goal |
| Momentum trend | "Gaining speed" / "Steady" / "New" |
| Recent activity | "12 new backers today" |
| Community size | How many people are following/discussing |
| Shares | How many times shared outside the platform |

**Discovery feeds:**

| Feed | Content |
|------|---------|
| Trending | Projects gaining momentum fastest right now |
| Near You | Projects in your geographic area |
| Your Communities | Projects from communities you follow |
| Almost There | Projects close to their funding goal (cascade incoming) |
| New | Recently proposed projects looking for early backers |
| Following | Updates from projects and people you follow |

**Community features:**

- **Discussion threads** on each project -- ask questions, share support, debate
- **Updates from proposers** -- progress photos, milestones, news
- **Community pages** -- groups organized around a cause, a location, or an interest
- **Follow** people, projects, and communities for updates

**The organic cascade:** When a project hits a tipping point -- enough backers, enough momentum, enough community energy -- it naturally accelerates. People see others joining and want to be part of it. This is the "one by one, all at once" effect. Deluge's job is to make that momentum visible and shareable, not to manufacture it.

**Success metric:** 30%+ of project funding comes from users who discovered the project through community features (not direct links).

---

### Flow 4: Cascade Moment (Project Fully Funded)

**Objective:** Create a memorable, shareable celebration when a project reaches 100%. The cascade belongs to everyone who contributed -- no single hero, just a community that made it happen.

**For every backer (the collective moment):**
- Push notification: "CASCADE! [Project name] is fully funded!"
- Cascade animation: water rushing over cliff, with a count of all backers
- Badge: "Cascade -- [Project name]" (unique per project, a keepsake)
- Social share prompt: "347 of us just funded [project]. One by one, all at once."
- Personal note: "You were 1 of 347 people who made this real."

**For the project proposer:**
- Notification: "Your community funded your project!"
- Next steps: disbursement timeline, reporting requirements
- Celebration: featured on platform, community notification
- Prompted to post a thank-you update to all backers

**For the community:**
- Community page banner: "YOUR COMMUNITY JUST TRIGGERED A CASCADE"
- Community milestone updated (total projects funded)
- Discussion thread auto-created for celebration

**Platform-wide:**
- Homepage banner: "LATEST CASCADE: [Project] -- funded by [N] people"
- Public celebration feed
- Update on what's next for the project

**Post-cascade (this is where it gets real):**
- Ongoing updates from the proposer as the project is executed
- Photo/video updates shared with all backers -- "Here's what your money built"
- Impact reporting when milestones are hit: "500 students now using the lab you funded"
- Invite backers to follow the proposer's next project

**Why no individual hero:** The cascade metaphor is about collective force. No single raindrop takes credit for the river. Celebrating one person as the "trigger" creates FOMO, incentivizes racing to be last, and undermines the "one by one, all at once" message. Every backer matters equally.

**Success metric:** 50%+ of cascade participants back another project within 14 days.

---

## Gamification System

### Design Principles

Gamification in a financial product carries real responsibility. Every mechanic must pass one test: **does this reward behavior that's good for the user and their community, or does it pressure them to spend more money?**

**We reward:**
- Impact outcomes (what the money *did*, not how much was spent)
- Community participation (proposing, promoting, discussing, sharing)
- Consistency and habit (showing up regularly, regardless of amount)
- Individual growth within collective progress

**We never reward:**
- Dollar amounts invested (no "$1K Club" or spending-based leaderboards)
- Competitive spending (no "invest more than your friend" challenges)
- Individual hero moments that create FOMO or racing behavior
- Breadth of spending for completionism's sake

This isn't just regulatory caution -- it's alignment with the mission. The deluge is made of drops, not whales. A user who invests $5/month through ad credits and shares projects with their community is just as valuable as someone investing $500/month.

---

---

### Leaderboards

Leaderboards rank **participation and impact**, never dollar amounts. The person who invests $5 and shares with 20 friends ranks higher than someone who quietly invests $5,000.

| Type | Ranked By | Resets |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Friends | Projects backed, badges earned, communities joined | Rolling |
| Community | Members contributing, projects proposed and funded, discussion activity | Monthly |
| Regional | Projects funded in your area, local community growth | Monthly |
| Impact | Verified outcomes from projects you backed (students served, trees planted, etc.) | Quarterly |

**What you'll never see:** Rankings by total dollars invested. That's a spending leaderboard, not an impact leaderboard.

**Rewards for active participants:** Special badges, temporary premium access, in-app recognition, invitations to community events.

---

### Collections

Collections celebrate meaningful patterns of engagement, not spending checkboxes. Each collection tells a story about who you are as an investor and community member.

**Impact Collections (tied to real-world outcomes):**
- "Classroom Builder" -- backed projects that served 500+ students
- "Earth Keeper" -- backed projects that protected 100+ acres or planted 1,000+ trees
- "Launchpad" -- backed 3 innovation projects that reached completion
- "Community Roots" -- backed 5 projects in your own city

**Community Collections (tied to participation):**
- "Voice" -- posted 50 discussion comments across projects
- "Megaphone" -- shared projects that brought in 100+ new backers
- "Architect" -- proposed 3+ projects that went live
- "Bridge Builder" -- active member in 5+ communities

**Milestone Collections (tied to consistency):**
- "Early Adopter" -- joined in Year 1
- "Year of Rain" -- invested every month for 12 months
- "Cascade Collection" -- part of 5 fully-funded projects
- "Full Circle" -- followed a project from proposal to completed impact report

---

### Challenges

Challenges are collective, not competitive. The community works toward shared goals. Individuals contribute however they can -- cash, ad-earned credit, sharing, promoting.

**Monthly Community Challenges:**
- Example: "March for Education" -- platform goal of funding 5 education projects this month
- Progress bar shows collective community effort
- Everyone who participates (any amount, including ad-earned) gets a challenge badge
- Bonus: if the goal is hit, Deluge matches 5% on next month's impact allocations

**Consistency Challenges:**
- "30-Day Flow" -- invest or watch ads every day for 30 days
- "Bring a Friend Month" -- invite someone new who makes their first investment
- "Discussion Month" -- comment on 10 different projects
- Individual goals, individual pace -- no competition against other users

**Seasonal Events:**
- "Back to School" (August/September) -- education project spotlight, community rallies
- "Earth Month" (April) -- environment project spotlight, collective impact goal
- "Giving Season" (November/December) -- all categories, year-in-review, impact celebration

**What you won't see:** "Invest more than your friend" or "Who can invest the most this month?" Challenges are about showing up and participating, not outspending each other.

---

## Ad-Funded Investment Experience

Watching ads to earn investment credit is a core accessibility feature. For users who can't invest cash, this is their entry point to wealth-building and community impact. The experience must feel dignified, transparent, and rewarding -- never exploitative, never dark-patterned.

### First-Time Ad Watcher Onboarding

**Trigger:** User taps "Watch ads to invest" for the first time (from the payment screen, dashboard, or Earn tab).

**Step 1: Educational overlay**

A 3-screen walkthrough that sets expectations honestly:

- **Screen 1 -- How it works:** "Advertisers pay to show you a 30-second video. We split that payment with you. Your share gets invested -- just like a cash deposit." Simple flow diagram: Advertiser > Deluge > You.
- **Screen 2 -- What to expect:** "Each ad earns approximately $0.01 for your account. That's small per ad, but real over time. Watch 10 ads a day, and you're investing roughly $2.70 a month -- without spending a dollar." Show a simple projection: daily, monthly, yearly.
- **Screen 3 -- Transparency promise:** "We'll always show you exactly how much the advertiser paid, how much Deluge kept, and how much went to you. No hidden math."

**Step 2: Choose your default impact project**

Before the first ad plays, prompt the user to select which project receives the impact portion (15%) of their ad earnings. Show 3-4 trending projects with thumbnails and one-line descriptions. "You can change this anytime."

**Step 3: Consent screen**

Clear, concise data and privacy notice:

- "We share anonymized viewing data with ad networks (not your financial data)."
- "You can stop watching ads at any time -- your earned balance stays yours."
- Checkbox: "I understand how ad-funded investing works."
- CTA: "Start earning" (Deep Ocean Blue button)

---

### Ad Watching Flow

The step-by-step experience of watching an ad and earning investment credit.

**1. Entry point**

Dedicated "Earn" tab in the bottom navigation (or a prominent "Earn" button on the dashboard). The tab shows:

- Today's progress: "3 of 10 ads watched"
- Today's earnings so far: "$0.027"
- Current streak: "12 days"
- CTA: "Watch next ad" (Deep Ocean Blue)

**2. Pre-ad screen**

A brief interstitial before the video loads:

- Progress ring showing daily completion (3/10 filled)
- Estimated earnings for completing today's remaining ads
- Current streak count and next streak milestone ("4 more days to 2-week streak!")
- "Ready?" button

**3. Tap to start**

- Loading state: water-droplet spinner with "Finding an ad for you..."
- Video player appears full-screen (or near-full-screen with a small Deluge header bar)

**4. Video plays**

- 30-second video ad
- No skip button -- the ad must be watched in full
- Minimal controls: mute toggle only
- Thin progress bar at top showing time remaining
- Deluge branding stays visible in header ("Earning for you...")

**5. Completion**

- Checkmark animation overlays the final frame
- Brief pause (0.5 seconds), then transition to the crediting screen

**6. Crediting screen**

This is the key moment -- see "The Crediting Experience" below for full detail.

**7. Post-credit prompt**

- "Watch another?" button with updated progress (4/10)
- "Done for now" option (no guilt, no pressure)
- If daily cap reached, celebratory completion screen instead

---

### The Crediting Experience

This is the most important screen in the ad flow. It's the moment the user sees their time convert into real money, split transparently between their portfolio and their chosen project. This must feel honest, rewarding, and educational.

**The transparency animation (2-3 seconds):**

1. Top line appears: "Advertiser paid **$0.015**" (full ad revenue, shown in Storm Gray)
2. Split animation: the amount divides into two streams flowing downward
3. Left stream: "Deluge keeps **$0.006**" (40% -- platform operating cost, shown in Storm Gray with a small "keeps the lights on" label)
4. Right stream lands with emphasis: "**You earned $0.009**" (60% -- shown in Rain Gold #FFA000, the hero number)

**The investment split (1-2 seconds):**

The user's $0.009 splits again with a gentle fork animation:

- Left: "**$0.00765 to your portfolio**" (85%) -- shown with a small portfolio icon and Rain Gold accent
- Right: "**$0.00135 to [Project Name]**" (15%) -- shown with the project thumbnail and Sky Blue accent

**Running totals update live:**

Three counters at the bottom of the screen tick upward as the credit lands:

| Counter | Label | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Today's earnings | "Earned today" | $0.027 > $0.036 |
| Portfolio balance | "Portfolio" | $14.52 > $14.52765 |
| Project contribution | "[Project Name]" | $2.31 > $2.31135 |

**Micro-celebration:**

- Drop sound effect (from brand sound design)
- Ripple animation emanates from the earned amount
- "+$0.009" floats upward and fades (Rain Gold)
- Subtle but satisfying -- not over-the-top

**"Watch another?" prompt:**

- Progress bar updates: "4 of 10 today"
- "Watch another" button (primary, Deep Ocean Blue)
- "Done for now" link (secondary, no guilt language)
- If this was ad 10/10: "You've earned your max for today!" with a completion animation (see Edge Cases)

---

### Ad Dashboard / Earnings View

A dedicated view (accessible from the Earn tab or portfolio settings) that gives users full visibility into their ad-funded investment history.

**Daily progress section:**

- Water-filling progress bar toward 10-ad daily cap (styled as a container filling with water, 0-100%)
- Number of ads watched today vs. cap: "7 / 10"
- Today's total earnings with full transparency: "Earned $0.063 today ($0.054 to portfolio, $0.009 to impact)"

**Streak section:**

| Metric | Display |
|--------|---------|
| Current streak | "12 days" with flame or water-stream icon |
| Longest streak | "23 days" |
| Next milestone | "Watch 2 more days for a 2-week streak!" |

Streak is defined as watching at least 1 ad per day on consecutive calendar days.

**Monthly summary card:**

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Total earned this month | $1.89 |
| Credited to portfolio (85%) | $1.61 |
| Credited to impact projects (15%) | $0.28 |
| Ads watched | 210 |

**Historical chart:**

- Time-series bar or line chart showing daily or weekly ad earnings over the past 1M, 3M, 6M, or ALL timeframes
- Toggle between "Earnings" and "Ads watched" views
- Color-coded: Rain Gold (#FFA000) for portfolio portion, Sky Blue (#42A5F5) for impact portion

**Projects funded section:**

- List of projects that received the impact portion of ad earnings
- Each entry shows: project name, total contributed from your ads, project status
- Tapping a project navigates to the project detail page

---

### Edge Cases & Error States

Every error state should feel honest and human. No dark patterns. No guilt. No manufactured urgency.

**Daily cap reached:**

- Screen: "You've earned your max for today!" (celebratory, not blocking)
- Show today's total earnings and portfolio/impact breakdown
- Water-fill progress bar at 100% with a gentle shimmer animation
- "Come back tomorrow to keep building." (encouraging, not demanding)
- Display: next streak milestone, tomorrow's available earnings estimate

**No ad inventory:**

- Screen: "No ads available right now. Try again in a few minutes."
- Honest explanation: "Ad availability varies throughout the day. It's not you -- it's the ad networks."
- No countdown timer (we don't know when inventory will return)
- Suggest: "In the meantime, check out your portfolio or explore projects."

**Ad closed or interrupted mid-view:**

- Screen: "Ad wasn't completed -- no credit this time."
- Neutral tone, no punishment: "You can try again whenever you're ready."
- Progress stays where it was (no lost progress on previously completed ads)
- If network interruption (not user-initiated): auto-retry once, then show the above message

**Network issues:**

- If connection drops during ad load: "Couldn't load the ad. Check your connection and try again."
- If connection drops mid-view: cache the viewing state. If the ad completed before the drop, credit it when connectivity returns. If not, treat as interrupted.
- Never lose progress on already-credited ads -- all crediting is server-confirmed before updating local state

**Anti-fraud verification (CAPTCHA):**

- Triggered occasionally based on viewing patterns (not every session)
- Framing: "Quick verification" with a simple image or tap challenge
- Tone: matter-of-fact, not accusatory -- "Just making sure you're human. Tap the images with water."
- Failure: "Verification didn't pass. Try again or come back later." (no account penalty for a single failure)

---

### Ad Content Guidelines

Deluge reviews and controls the categories of ads shown to users. Users spend their time watching these ads to build wealth -- the content should respect that exchange.

**Acceptable ad categories:**

- Consumer brands (retail, food, technology, entertainment)
- Financial services (banks, insurance -- not predatory lending)
- Education and career services
- Health and wellness
- Family-friendly entertainment
- Brands aligned with social impact, sustainability, or community themes

**Prohibited ad categories:**

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Gambling and sports betting | Conflicts with responsible financial behavior |
| Cryptocurrency speculation | Conflicts with long-term, diversified investing philosophy |
| Scams, MLM, "get rich quick" | Exploitative, undermines trust |
| Adult content | Not family-friendly; Deluge is for all ages |
| Competitors (investment apps) | Direct conflict of interest |
| Predatory lending (payday loans, high-interest) | Contradicts mission of financial empowerment |
| Political ads | Divisive; Deluge is non-partisan |
| Tobacco and vaping | Health concerns |

**User controls:**

- "Report this ad" button available during and after every ad view
- Report categories: inappropriate content, misleading claims, offensive material, other
- Reported ads are flagged for review and blocked from showing to the reporting user immediately
- If an ad receives reports from 3+ users, it's auto-paused pending manual review

**Platform moderation:**

- Deluge pre-approves ad categories through the ad mediation platform (AdMob, ironSource, etc.)
- Quarterly review of ad category performance and user report trends
- Blocklist maintained and updated for specific advertisers and creatives
- Quality bar: prefer fewer, better ads over maximizing fill rate

## Personal Financial Experience

Promote the collective without forgetting the need to better the individual. The personal dashboard is where users see their wealth growing, their impact accumulating, and their financial knowledge deepening -- before they ever look at the community feed. If we don't make the individual experience compelling, there is no collective.

### Personal Dashboard Design

The dashboard is what users see when they open the app. Portfolio performance is front and center. Community is one tap away, but the first thing a user sees is: "How am I doing?"

**Information hierarchy (top to bottom):**

1. **Portfolio value + today's change** -- the hero number. Large, bold, Rain Gold (#FFA000) for gains, Storm Gray (#455A64) for flat. Example: "$1,247.83 (+$3.12 today)"
2. **Personal impact summary** -- smaller but visible below portfolio. "Your contributions have helped serve 847 students across 4 projects."
3. **Community activity** -- compact feed preview. "3 projects you follow have new updates."

**Two primary tabs:**

| Tab | What It Shows | Default |
|-----|---------------|---------|
| **My Wealth** | Portfolio performance, allocation, contributions, projections | Default view on open |
| **My Impact** | Impact dollars deployed, projects backed, outcomes, timeline | One tap away |

The tab bar sits just below the portfolio hero number so both views share the same top-level context.

**Empty state (new users, first session):**

- Portfolio value shows "$0.00" with a welcoming message, not a blank screen
- "Your journey starts here. Make your first investment or watch an ad to earn your first drop."
- Illustration: single raindrop landing on still water, ripples forming
- Quick-action buttons: "Invest now" and "Watch an ad to earn"
- No pressure, no countdown -- just an invitation

**Established state (returning users):**

- Portfolio value with today's change animates in on load (counter ticks up to current value)
- Sparkline chart showing the past week's performance below the hero number
- Quick-action row: "Add funds," "Watch ads," "Explore projects"
- Any unseen milestones trigger a gentle overlay (see Private Financial Milestones)
- Notification badge on the My Impact tab if new project updates are available

### Portfolio Visualization

The My Wealth tab gives users a full, interactive view of their investment performance. Designed to be informative without being overwhelming -- a user who's never opened a brokerage app should be able to understand this at a glance.

**Performance chart:**

- Time-series line chart showing portfolio value over time
- Toggle buttons for time range: **1W** | **1M** | **3M** | **1Y** | **ALL**
- Touch/hover on any point to see the value and date
- Line color: Rain Gold (#FFA000) for periods of gain, Storm Gray (#455A64) for periods of decline
- Smooth curves (not jagged point-to-point) for readability
- Optional benchmark overlay: S&P 500 index line (dashed, lighter color) for context. Toggled on/off by the user, off by default. Label: "S&P 500 (for reference)"

**Key numbers (displayed above or beside the chart):**

| Metric | Display | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Current balance | Large, bold | $1,247.83 |
| Total returns ($) | Signed, colored | +$97.83 |
| Total returns (%) | Signed, colored | +8.5% |
| Today's change | Smaller, below balance | +$3.12 (+0.25%) |

Returns colored Rain Gold (#FFA000) for positive, a muted red for negative (not alarm-red -- financial apps should normalize fluctuation, not dramatize it).

**Allocation breakdown:**

- Pie chart or horizontal stacked bar showing current portfolio allocation (e.g., 60% stocks / 40% bonds)
- Tapping a segment shows the underlying funds or ETFs
- Clean, minimal -- two or three segments maximum for most users

**Contribution history:**

- Bar chart or timeline showing deposits over time (cash investments and ad-earned credits)
- Color-coded: one color for cash deposits, another for ad-earned credits
- Monthly totals with the option to drill into individual transactions
- Helps users see their consistency ("I've invested every month for 6 months")

### Private Financial Milestones

**Philosophy:** Celebrate personal growth without competition. These milestones are PRIVATE -- they never appear on leaderboards, in community feeds, or on public profiles. They exist to reinforce good financial habits and mark meaningful moments in a user's journey.

This system is distinct from the public achievement badge system. Public badges celebrate community participation and impact engagement. Private milestones celebrate personal financial progress. The two systems do not overlap.

**Milestone categories:**

| Category | Examples | What It Celebrates |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| Consistency | 1-month investing streak, 3-month streak, 6-month streak, 1-year streak | Showing up regularly, regardless of amount |
| Portfolio value | First $10, first $100, first $500, first $1,000 | Growing your wealth over time |
| Returns | First dollar earned in returns, first $10 in returns, first $100 in returns | Seeing your money work for you |
| Learning | Completed first learning module, finished beginner pathway, reached "confident" level | Growing your financial knowledge |

**Important:** No milestone is tied to a specific dollar amount invested in a single transaction. Milestones track cumulative portfolio value and cumulative returns, not spending. A user who reaches $100 through two years of ad-earned credits celebrates the same milestone as someone who deposited $100 on day one.

**Delivery:**

- Milestones appear as gentle in-app moments: a brief overlay when the user opens the app or navigates to the dashboard
- Visual: a quiet animation (raindrop landing, small ripple) with the milestone name and a one-line message
- Examples:
  - "Steady Flow -- You've invested every month for 6 months. That consistency is building something real."
  - "First Hundred -- Your portfolio just crossed $100. Every drop adds up."
  - "First Returns -- You just earned your first dollar in market returns. Your money is working alongside you."
- The user taps to dismiss or taps "Learn more" for context (e.g., "What are market returns?")
- Once seen, milestones are logged in a private "My Milestones" section accessible from the portfolio view
- No push notification -- these are discovered naturally when the user opens the app

**Journey examples:**

| Timeframe | Possible Milestones |
|-----------|-------------------|
| First week | "First Drop" (public badge), first ad-earned credit (private), chose first impact project (private) |
| 3 months in | 3-month consistency streak (private), portfolio crossed $50 (private), completed beginner learning pathway (private), "Steady Flow" (public badge) |
| 1 year in | 12-month streak (private), portfolio crossed $500 (private), earned $25 in returns (private), "Year of Flow" (public badge) |

### Financial Literacy Integration

Contextual financial education woven into the portfolio experience. Not a separate "learn" section the user has to seek out -- the learning comes to them, tied to real events in their portfolio.

**Contextual learning moments:**

Triggered by real portfolio events, these are short, educational messages that appear as expandable cards within the dashboard:

| Trigger | Learning Moment |
|---------|----------------|
| Portfolio drops 2%+ in a day | "Your portfolio is down today -- here's why that's normal. Markets fluctuate daily. Over the past 50 years, the market has finished positive in ~75% of calendar years despite regular short-term drops." |
| First dividend payment received | "You just received a dividend! Companies share a portion of their profits with investors. This $0.12 was automatically reinvested in your portfolio." |
| User has held portfolio for 1 year | "You've been investing for a year. Here's what compounding has done for you so far..." with a visual showing returns earned on returns. |
| Market hits all-time high | "The market just hit an all-time high. That sounds dramatic, but it happens regularly -- the market has hit a new high roughly every 15 trading days on average over the past decade." |

**"Learn More" expandable cards:**

Persistent educational cards within the portfolio view that users can expand at their own pace:

- **What is an ETF?** -- "Your money is invested in ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). Think of an ETF as a basket of hundreds of stocks bundled together..."
- **What is compounding?** -- "Compounding means your returns earn their own returns. Here's how $10/month grows over 10, 20, and 30 years..." (with a simple chart)
- **What are dividends?** -- "Some companies pay a small portion of their profits to shareholders..."
- **What does diversification mean?** -- "Your portfolio holds many different investments so that no single company's performance determines your outcome..."

Cards appear contextually (the ETF card appears when a user first views their allocation; the compounding card appears after the first month of returns).

**Learning pathway:**

| Level | Name | Criteria | What It Means |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Beginner | Signed up, invested, read 0-2 cards | Just getting started |
| 2 | Comfortable | Read 5+ learning cards, held portfolio 3+ months | Understanding the basics |
| 3 | Confident | Completed all core learning modules, held portfolio 6+ months, used projection tools | Solid financial foundation |

Progress is tracked privately in the user's profile. There is one optional public connection: completing the beginner pathway unlocks a "Financial Literacy" badge in the public achievement system. This is the only bridge between private learning progress and public recognition.

**Content source:**

Learning content lives IN the app experience (not external links). It connects to Deluge's blog and content strategy but is delivered as native UI cards, not web views. Content is written in plain language at a high-school reading level. No jargon without explanation.

### Personal Impact Identity ("My Impact" View)

The second tab on the dashboard. While "My Wealth" shows financial growth, "My Impact" shows the real-world outcomes of the user's participation. This is the emotional core of the experience.

**Aggregate view (top of the tab):**

| Metric | Display | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Total impact dollars deployed | Hero number | "$187.35 to real projects" |
| Number of projects backed | Count with icon | "7 projects" |
| Communities joined | Count with icon | "3 communities" |

**Project-by-project breakdown:**

A scrollable list of every project the user has backed, showing:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Project name | "Denver Youth STEM Lab" |
| Your contribution | "$43.20 (from cash + ad earnings)" |
| Project status | "In progress -- 78% funded" or "Completed" |
| Outcome metric | "Serving 312 students so far" |

Tapping a project navigates to the full project detail page.

**Outcome metrics tied to YOUR money:**

Where possible, show impact metrics scaled to the user's contribution relative to the project total:

- "Your contributions helped serve 847 students" (calculated proportionally from the user's share of total project funding)
- "You helped protect 2.3 acres of forest" (proportional to contribution)
- These numbers are approximate and labeled as such: "Based on your share of project funding"

This makes the impact feel personal without creating competition around dollar amounts. A user who contributed $5 sees a smaller but real number. A user who contributed $500 sees a larger one. Both matter.

**Timeline of your impact journey:**

A vertical timeline showing the user's impact milestones in chronological order:

- "Jan 15 -- Backed 'Denver Youth STEM Lab' ($25)"
- "Feb 3 -- First project update received: 'Lab equipment arriving!'"
- "Mar 20 -- Project funded! (CASCADE)"
- "Apr 8 -- Impact report: 312 students served in first month"

Each entry is tappable, expanding to show the full update, photos, or report.

**Post-cascade updates:**

After a project the user backed reaches full funding and begins execution, updates flow back to the My Impact tab:

- Photos from the project site ("The lab is open!")
- Progress reports from the proposer
- Milestone announcements ("500th student served")
- Final impact reports with verified metrics

These updates are what close the loop -- the user sees their money turn into real outcomes. This is the emotional payoff that drives retention and re-investment.

### Projection Tools

A forward-looking calculator that helps users visualize what their current habits will produce over time. Accessible from the My Wealth tab as a "See your future" card.

**"At your current pace" calculator:**

Based on the user's actual behavior (average monthly contribution, current portfolio value, time invested), show a projection:

- "At your current pace of $15/month, here's where you could be:"
- Chart showing projected portfolio value at 5, 10, 20, and 30 years
- Uses a range (conservative 5%, base 7%, optimistic 10% annual return) displayed as a shaded confidence band, not a single line

**Adjustable inputs:**

| Input | Default | Range |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Monthly contribution | User's actual average | $5 - $500 slider |
| Time horizon | 10 years | 1 - 40 years slider |
| Expected return | 7% (historical average) | 5% - 10% range shown as band |

**Side-by-side projection:**

The key differentiator: show both wealth AND impact projections together.

| Column | Example (10 years, $25/month) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Your wealth in 10 years | ~$4,300 (at 7% avg return on 85%) |
| Your cumulative impact in 10 years | ~$450 deployed to projects (15% of contributions) |

This reinforces the dual value proposition: you're building wealth AND creating impact simultaneously.

**Educational framing and disclaimers:**

- "These projections use historical market averages and are not promises of future returns."
- "Actual returns will vary. Markets go up and down. The projections show a range of possibilities."
- "Past performance does not guarantee future results."
- Disclaimers are visible but not overwhelming -- a single line below the chart, not a wall of legal text
- The tool is educational, not advisory. It helps users understand the power of consistency and compounding.

**Goal-setting:**

- "Set a goal" button lets users define a private financial target
- Inputs: target amount (e.g., "$5,000"), target date (e.g., "December 2030")
- The dashboard shows progress toward the goal: "42% of the way to your $5,000 goal"
- Goals are private -- never displayed publicly or used in any ranking
- Multiple goals allowed (e.g., one for total portfolio, one for monthly contribution target)
- If the user's current pace won't reach the goal by the target date, gently suggest: "To reach your goal on time, consider increasing to $30/month" (suggestion only, never pressure)

### Individual-to-Collective Bridge

The personal dashboard is designed to be self-sufficient -- a user could use only the My Wealth and My Impact tabs and have a complete experience. But the bridge to community should be natural and inviting, never forced.

**"Your drop in the river" visual:**

On project detail pages, show a visualization of the user's contribution within the project's total funding. A water-fill progress bar with a highlighted section: "Your contributions: $43.20 of $12,450 raised." The user's portion is color-highlighted within the fill, showing their drop within the river. This reinforces both individual agency ("I'm part of this") and collective power ("Look what we built together").

**Transition points from personal to community:**

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| My Wealth tab | Community feed | "See what others are investing in" link at bottom of portfolio view |
| My Impact tab | Project page | Tapping any project in the impact breakdown |
| My Impact tab | Community page | Tapping a community in the "Communities joined" section |
| Dashboard (any tab) | Trending projects | "Explore projects" quick-action button |
| Milestone achieved | Related community challenge | "Others are working toward similar goals -- see this month's challenge" |

**Unified notification stream:**

The notification bell balances personal and community updates:

| Type | Example | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| Personal financial | "Your portfolio crossed $1,000" | High (shown first) |
| Personal impact | "Project you backed posted an update" | High |
| Community activity | "Denver Community just funded a project!" | Medium |
| Platform announcements | "New learning module available" | Low |

Notifications are grouped by type and time, with personal updates always surfacing above community updates. The user can adjust notification preferences in settings.

### Loading Screens

Instead of spinners, use stage-appropriate water animations:
- Early platform: raindrops falling
- Growing platform: streams flowing
- Scaled platform: rivers rushing

Animations evolve as the platform grows.
