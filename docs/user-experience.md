# User Experience

## User Personas

Deluge is a community-driven giving platform. The personas below are ordered by how central they are to the platform's mission. The first two represent the core users the platform is designed for. The rest represent important but secondary audiences.

### Persona 1: The Generous Over-Giver (Primary)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Angela, 34 |
| Occupation | Social Worker |
| Income | $48K/year |
| Location | Urban (Denver, CO) |

**Who she is:** Angela donates to every fundraiser in her feed and organized a neighborhood cleanup last month. Her generosity is genuine and constant -- but she spreads it thin across too many causes and never sees the result. She wants to know that her giving actually makes a difference.

**Goals:** Give back to her community. Feel like her contributions matter. Find projects that need help in her neighborhood. See exactly where her money goes and what it accomplishes.

**Pain points:** Existing platforms optimize for maximum giving with no transparency. She spreads her giving thin across too many causes and never sees the result. She wants to give meaningfully but doesn't know which causes need help most or whether her donations are making a difference.

**How Deluge helps:** Deluge helps Angela channel her giving into transparent, measurable community projects instead of spreading it thin. She watches ads on her commute, contributes small amounts ($5-10/month), and browses local businesses in the evening. Within a month she has watershed capital and proof that her contributions matter -- she can see exactly which projects her money funded, how many people were served, and what her community accomplished together.

**Key insight:** Angela is a giver who needs a better way to give -- transparently, collectively, and sustainably. The platform is built for her.

---

### Persona 2: The Community Contributor (Free Tier)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | DeAndre, 21 |
| Occupation | Part-time Retail + Community College |
| Income | $18K/year |
| Location | Urban (Atlanta, GA) |

**Who he is:** DeAndre has no cash to contribute but cares deeply about his neighborhood. He watches his community struggle with underfunded schools, littered streets, and businesses that come and go. He's physically capable and willing to put in work. He's frustrated that every platform assumes you need money to participate.

**Goals:** Contribute to his community without needing cash. Earn something for his effort. See tangible results from his participation. Be part of something bigger than himself.

**Pain points:** Every giving platform requires money he doesn't have. He has energy but no mechanism to convert that into community impact at scale.

**How Deluge helps:** DeAndre watches ads during breaks (earning $1.35/month to projects), browses local businesses in the evening (another $1/month), and refers three friends in his first month ($7.50 in watershed credits). Within weeks he has watershed capital and has helped fund his first microloan. DeAndre enters the community through attention and builds toward cash contributions as his circumstances change.

**Key insight:** DeAndre represents why the free-tier pathways exist. If Deluge only works for people with money, it fails its mission.

---

### Persona 3: Values-Driven Professional

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Sarah, 32 |
| Occupation | Marketing Manager |
| Income | $75K/year |
| Location | Urban (Denver, CO) |

**Goals:** Give according to her values (environment, education). See where her money goes. Be part of something bigger than individual charity. Full transparency into outcomes.

**Pain points:** Doesn't trust where charity money goes. Traditional giving feels disconnected from results. Wants transparency and community connection.

**How Deluge helps:** Start with $25/month. She directs her contributions to causes she cares about and sees exactly which projects her money funds. She joins the Denver education community, rallies behind a local STEM lab, watches it cascade to full funding, and gets impact reports showing 312 students served. The giving feels real. The transparency is built in.

---

### Persona 4: Purpose-Seeking Gen Z

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Marcus, 24 |
| Occupation | Software Developer |
| Income | $90K/year |
| Location | Suburban (Austin, TX) |

**Goals:** Use tech for good. Support innovation and education. Gamified, engaging experience. Real-time impact tracking.

**Pain points:** Charity feels disconnected from results. Wants to see metrics. Craves community connection.

**How Deluge helps:** Badges, streaks, and real-time impact dashboards. Tech/innovation category speaks to him. Community progress tracking. Sponsors a borrower, tracks their progress, watches the loan get repaid, and redeploys his watershed capital. The cycle makes him feel like his money is alive.

---

### Persona 5: Established Professional

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | David, 45 |
| Occupation | VP Operations |
| Income | $150K/year |
| Location | Suburban (Virginia) |

**Goals:** Teach kids about giving back and community impact. Give back to community. Smart tax strategies. Legacy and long-term thinking.

**Pain points:** Wants kids to learn about community responsibility. Current charity lacks transparency. Wants efficient giving (tax benefits). Skeptical of "impact" claims.

**How Deluge helps:** Family accounts for shared giving. Verified impact (third-party audited). Tax documentation for donations. Clear, institutional-grade reporting. His kids learn about giving back and community impact together.

---

### Persona 6: Local Business Owner

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Rosa, 41 |
| Occupation | Owner, Rosa's Bakery |
| Income | $55K/year (business revenue: $180K) |
| Location | Urban (Denver, CO) |

**Who she is:** Rosa has run her bakery for 6 years. She's a fixture in the neighborhood but can't afford traditional advertising. She cares about the community -- she donates leftover bread to the shelter and sponsors the little league team -- but these efforts are invisible to anyone outside her block.

**Goals:** Get more neighborhood visibility without a marketing budget. Be recognized as a community-oriented business. Connect her business to the neighborhood's wellbeing. Propose improvements to the block (better signage, a public bench, flower planters).

**Pain points:** Can't afford Facebook or Google ads. Yelp feels transactional. Her community contributions are invisible. She'd propose a project for her block but doesn't know where to start.

**How Deluge helps:** Rosa creates a free business card listing in 10 minutes. Neighborhood users discover her bakery while browsing -- and every view funds community projects. Her listing shows "Rosa's Bakery has contributed $47 to local projects this month" just by existing. She proposes a project to install flower planters on her block. Contributors fund the $80 budget. Rosa's block looks better, and 12 contributors funded something real for under $7 each.

**Key insight:** Rosa is both a participant and a beneficiary. She contributes to the ecosystem (listing generates project funding) and draws from it (proposes community projects). The business directory isn't a separate product -- it's another node in the community network.

---

### Persona 7: Corporate ESG Manager

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Jennifer, 38 |
| Occupation | Head of Sustainability |
| Income | Company budget |
| Location | Corporate HQ |

**Goals:** Meet ESG commitments. Engage employees meaningfully. Report impact metrics to the board. Stand out in ESG reporting.

**Pain points:** Current ESG programs feel like checkbox exercises. Low employee engagement. Hard to measure real impact. Expensive consultants.

**How Deluge helps:** White-label corporate program. Employee engagement through gamification. Ready-made impact reporting. Cost-effective alternative to consultants. Corporate ad matching funds amplify employee ad-watching into significant project funding -- "$25K matching fund, 500 employees watching ads, $13.50/month per employee to verified projects" is a compelling board report.

---

### Persona 8: The Philanthropist

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Catherine, 52 |
| Occupation | Retired CFO |
| Income | $400K/year |
| Location | Suburban (Scottsdale, AZ) |

**Who she is:** Catherine retired early after 25 years in finance. She has significant resources and no debt. She wants a platform that lets her deploy capital into communities efficiently and transparently. She currently writes checks to nonprofits but has no visibility into outcomes. She's tried donor-advised funds and finds them impersonal.

**Goals:** Deploy significant capital into community projects with full transparency. See verified impact outcomes. Support borrowers directly through microloans. Be part of a giving community, not just a checkbook.

**Pain points:** Traditional philanthropy is opaque -- she writes checks and gets annual reports full of overhead ratios. Donor-advised funds feel like parking money in a tax shelter. She wants more connection and transparency than traditional giving provides.

**How Deluge helps:** Catherine deploys capital into projects and microloans with full transparency -- all features are free. She backs 15 projects in her first month, sponsors 3 borrowers, and watches real-time impact reports flow back. Her watershed regenerates as microloans get repaid, and she redeploys into new projects. She sees exactly where every dollar goes. The community mechanics (cascading, collective funding, impact reports) give her something donor-advised funds never could: connection to the people her money helps.

**Key insight:** Catherine represents experienced philanthropists who want more connection and transparency than traditional giving provides. Full-featured free access and detailed impact reporting serve this audience.

---

## User Flows

### Flow 1: New User Onboarding

**Objective:** Connect a new user to something they care about and help them make their first contribution -- in any form -- within 5 minutes.

The onboarding leads with what the user cares about, not how they pay. The contribution pathway (cash, ads, browsing) comes after the user has found their community and a project worth caring about. This is a giving platform -- the emotional connection comes first, the mechanism comes second.

**Steps:**

1. **Landing page**
   - Hero: "Deluge: One by One, All at Once"
   - Value prop: "Give sustainably. Fund what your community cares about."
   - Secondary: "Every dollar transparent. Every project verifiable. Every drop counts."
   - CTA: "Join the deluge"

2. **Sign-up**
   - Email or social login
   - 30 seconds max

3. **Onboarding screens (4 slides)**
   - Slide 1: Raindrop animation -- "You want to give. We're here to help."
   - Slide 2: How it works -- "Contribute cash or attention. It all flows to your watershed — your personal impact fund. From there, you fund the projects and people that matter to your community."
   - Slide 3: Community forming -- "Find your people. Fund what matters. Together they've deployed $X to real projects."
   - Slide 4: Pathways -- "Contribute with cash, your attention, or both. Every path funds real change." Brief icons showing: cash contribution, video ads, local business browsing.

4. **What do you care about?**
   - Browse interest tags: education, environment, innovation, local community, housing, health, arts
   - "Near you" option highlights projects and communities in the user's area
   - See what's gaining momentum right now
   - Option: "Or explore on your own"

5. **Find your first project**
   - Community-promoted projects shown with momentum indicators, filtered by selected interests
   - Show: goal, progress, community size backing it, impact metrics
   - "243 people are rallying behind this. Join them."
6. **How do you want to contribute?**

   Present all pathways equally. No hierarchy, no pressure toward cash. The user picks what works for them.

   | Pathway | Description | CTA |
   |---------|-------------|-----|
   | **Contribute cash** | "Start with just $1. 100% goes to your watershed to fund projects and microloans." | "Contribute now" |
   | **Watch ads** | "Donate your attention. Each ad funds about $0.01 to this project." | "Watch your first ad" |
   | **Browse local businesses** | "Discover your neighborhood. Every view funds community projects." | "Start browsing" |
   If the user selects cash contribution:
   - Enter amount ($0.25 minimum; suggest $1, $5, $10, $25)
   - Payment method (Stripe)
   - Review breakdown: "100% goes to your watershed. From there, you fund the projects and people you care about."
   - The framing: every dollar is yours to deploy into your community.

   If the user selects ads:
   - Brief ad onboarding (3 screens -- see Ad-Funded Impact Experience)
   - First ad plays, crediting animation shows impact

   If the user selects browsing:
   - Opens the Browse Local section with nearby business cards
   - First few views show micro-credit animations

7. **Celebration**
   - Adapts to whichever pathway the user chose:
     - Cash: "You're a raindrop!" animation. "First Drop" badge unlocked.
     - Ads: "You just funded your first project with your attention." "Time Giver" badge unlocked.
     - Browsing: "You discovered [X] local businesses and funded $0.02 to [Project]." Counter animation.
   - All paths: "Share this project with your community" prompt
   - Navigate to dashboard

**Success metric:** 70%+ of new users complete a first contribution (any pathway) within their first session. Track pathway distribution to understand which on-ramps resonate.

---

### Flow 2: Propose a Project

**Objective:** Enable community members, nonprofits, and local organizations to submit projects for funding.

This is the core differentiator. Deluge doesn't decide what gets funded -- the community does. Anyone can propose; the crowd decides.

**Who can propose:**
- Individual community members (with verification)
- Registered nonprofits (501(c)(3) -- fast-tracked verification)
- Local organizations (schools, community groups, churches)
- Small businesses (for workforce/innovation projects)

**Proposal steps:**

1. **Start a project**
   - Title and description
   - Category tags (not limited to one -- a project can be "education" + "local" + "youth")
   - Location (city, state, or "national/global")
   - Funding goal and timeline

2. **Add details**
   - What the money will fund (specific, measurable)
   - Impact metrics: "How will you measure success?"
   - Media: photos, video, documents
   - Organization details (if applicable)

3. **Verification queue**
   - Deluge reviews for legitimacy (not quality or popularity -- that's the community's job)
   - Verification checklist:
     - Is the proposer real? (identity verification)
     - Is the organization legitimate? (501(c)(3) check, business registration)
     - Is the project legal and within platform guidelines?
     - Are the funds traceable? (bank account verification)
   - Target: 48-72 hour review for most proposals
   - Nonprofits with GuideStar verification: fast-tracked (24 hours)

4. **Go live**
   - Project appears on platform
   - Proposer shares with their network
   - Community discovers, promotes, and funds it organically

**What Deluge does NOT judge:**
- Whether the project is "good enough"
- Whether it will succeed
- Whether it's popular enough
- Whether it fits a specific category perfectly

**What Deluge DOES verify:**
- The proposer is who they say they are
- The organization is legitimate
- The project is legal and within guidelines
- Funds can be tracked and reported on

**Success metric:** Average time from proposal to live < 72 hours. 20%+ of active users have proposed or promoted a project.

---

### Flow 3: Community Promotion & Momentum

**Objective:** Let communities organically surface the projects they care about. Funding follows enthusiasm.

**How projects gain momentum:**

1. **Sharing** -- users share projects to their networks (social media, email, in-app)
2. **Backing** -- users fund a project, which shows commitment
3. **Promoting** -- users "boost" a project within the platform (similar to an upvote, but backed by their contribution)
4. **Rallying** -- users create "rally" campaigns: "Can we get 100 people behind this by Friday?"

**Momentum indicators (visible on every project):**

| Indicator | What It Shows |
|-----------|---------------|
| Backer count | "347 people have contributed to this project" |
| Funding progress | Water-fill progress bar toward goal |
| Momentum trend | "Gaining speed" / "Steady" / "New" |
| Recent activity | "12 new backers today" |
| Community size | How many people are following/discussing |
| Shares | How many times shared outside the platform |

**Discovery feeds:**

| Feed | Content |
|------|---------|
| Trending | Projects gaining momentum fastest right now |
| Near You | Projects in your geographic area |
| Your Communities | Projects from communities you follow |
| Almost There | Projects close to their funding goal (cascade incoming) |
| New | Recently proposed projects looking for early backers |
| Following | Updates from projects and people you follow |

**Community features:**

- **Discussion threads** on each project -- ask questions, share support, debate
- **Updates from proposers** -- progress photos, milestones, news
- **Community pages** -- groups organized around a cause, a location, or an interest
- **Follow** people, projects, and communities for updates

**The organic cascade:** When a project hits a tipping point -- enough backers, enough momentum, enough community energy -- it naturally accelerates. People see others joining and want to be part of it. This is the "one by one, all at once" effect. Deluge's job is to make that momentum visible and shareable, not to manufacture it.

**Success metric:** 30%+ of project funding comes from users who discovered the project through community features (not direct links).

---

### Flow 4: Cascade Moment (Project Fully Funded)

**Objective:** Create a memorable, shareable celebration when a project reaches 100%. The cascade belongs to everyone who contributed -- no single hero, just a community that made it happen.

**For every backer (the collective moment):**
- Push notification: "CASCADE! [Project name] is fully funded!"
- Cascade animation: water rushing over cliff, with a count of all backers
- Badge: "Cascade -- [Project name]" (unique per project, a keepsake)
- Social share prompt: "347 of us just funded [project]. One by one, all at once."
- Personal note: "You were 1 of 347 people who made this real."

**For the project proposer:**
- Notification: "Your community funded your project!"
- Next steps: disbursement timeline, reporting requirements
- Celebration: featured on platform, community notification
- Prompted to post a thank-you update to all backers

**For the community:**
- Community page banner: "YOUR COMMUNITY JUST TRIGGERED A CASCADE"
- Community milestone updated (total projects funded)
- Discussion thread auto-created for celebration

**Platform-wide:**
- Homepage banner: "LATEST CASCADE: [Project] -- funded by [N] people"
- Public celebration feed
- Update on what's next for the project

**Post-cascade (this is where it gets real):**
- Ongoing updates from the proposer as the project is executed
- Photo/video updates shared with all backers -- "Here's what your money built"
- Impact reporting when milestones are hit: "500 students now using the lab you funded"
- Invite backers to follow the proposer's next project

**Why no individual hero:** The cascade metaphor is about collective force. No single raindrop takes credit for the river. Celebrating one person as the "trigger" creates FOMO, incentivizes racing to be last, and undermines the "one by one, all at once" message. Every backer matters equally.

**Success metric:** 50%+ of cascade participants back another project within 14 days.

---

### Flow 5: Referral Program

**Objective:** Give users a simple way to invite friends and earn watershed credits, while protecting the platform against referral fraud.

**Entry points:**
- "Invite friends" button on the dashboard
- Share prompt after cascade moments
- Dedicated referral section in user profile

**Referral flow:**

1. **Generate referral link**
   - User taps "Invite friends" -- unique referral link generated
   - Share options: copy link, text message, email, social media
   - Link expires after 7 days of inactivity from the referred user

2. **Friend signs up using link**
   - Referrer receives notification: "[Friend's name] signed up! $0.50 credited to your watershed."
   - First milestone vested immediately

3. **Friend completes first action**
   - Notification: "[Friend] watched their first 5 ads! $1.00 credited to your watershed." (or $1.50 if friend made a cash contribution)
   - Second milestone vested

4. **Friend is active at Day 30**
   - Notification: "[Friend] has been active for 30 days! $1.00 credited to your watershed."
   - Final milestone vested

**Referral dashboard (in user profile):**

| Metric | Display |
|--------|---------|
| Friends referred | "8 friends joined through your link" |
| Active referrals | "6 are still active" |
| Total earned | "$18.50 in watershed credits from referrals" |
| Monthly remaining | "2 of 10 referral slots remaining this month" |
| Lifetime remaining | "42 of 50 lifetime referrals remaining" |

**Milestone tracker per referral:**

Each referred friend shows a 3-step progress indicator:
- Step 1: Signed up ✓ ($0.50)
- Step 2: First action ✓ ($1.00)
- Step 3: Active 30 days (pending -- 12 days remaining)

**Success metric:** 15%+ of new signups come through referral links. Referral-acquired users retain at 1.5x the rate of paid-acquired users.

---

## Gamification System

### Design Principles

Gamification in a giving platform carries real responsibility. Every mechanic must pass one test: **does this reward behavior that's good for the user and their community, or does it pressure them to spend more money?**

**We reward:**
- Impact outcomes (what the money *did*, not how much was spent)
- Community participation (proposing, promoting, discussing, sharing)
- Consistency and habit (showing up regularly, regardless of amount)
- Individual growth within collective progress

**We never reward:**
- Dollar amounts contributed (no "$1K Club" or spending-based leaderboards)
- Spending competitions (no "give more than your friend" challenges)
- Individual hero moments that create FOMO or racing behavior
- Breadth of spending for completionism's sake

This isn't just regulatory caution -- it's alignment with the mission. The deluge is made of drops, not whales. A user who gives $5/month and watches ads to fund projects in their community is just as valuable as someone giving $500/month.

---

---

### Community Progress

Deluge focuses on **collective progress**, not individual competition. There are no individual leaderboards or rankings. This is about building something together, not racing against each other.

**Platform Impact Dashboard:**

The Progress page shows what we've accomplished as a platform:

| Metric | Display | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Total members | Count | "4,200 members" |
| Projects funded | Count + trend | "89 projects funded -- 12 this month" |
| Loans funded | Count | "156 loans funded" |
| Total watershed flow | Aggregate | "$48,200 has flowed through watersheds" |

**Communities Making Waves:**

Communities are highlighted by their collective impact -- how many projects their members have backed, how many loans they've supported. This celebrates community effort, not individual achievement.

| Metric | Display | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Projects backed | Count | "Denver Metro: 34 projects backed" |
| Loans supported | Count | "Austin Tech: 28 loans supported" |
| Member count | Count | "89 members" |

**Your Progress (Private):**

Personal stats are shown only to you -- ads watched, projects backed, loans funded, badges earned, current streak. These are for your own reflection and motivation, never displayed publicly or ranked against others.

**What you'll never see:**
- Individual rankings or leaderboards
- Dollar-amount comparisons between users
- "Top giver" or "most generous" designations
- Competition-based challenges that pit users against each other

**Why no leaderboards:** Individual rankings create FOMO, racing behavior, and a "hero" mentality that undermines the collective spirit. The cascade metaphor is about collective force -- no single raindrop takes credit for the river. Every contribution matters equally, regardless of amount.

---

### Collections

Collections celebrate meaningful patterns of engagement, not spending checkboxes. Each collection tells a story about who you are as a giver and community member.

**Impact Collections (tied to real-world outcomes):**
- "Classroom Builder" -- backed projects that served 500+ students
- "Earth Keeper" -- backed projects that protected 100+ acres or planted 1,000+ trees
- "Launchpad" -- backed 3 innovation projects that reached completion
- "Community Roots" -- backed 5 projects in your own city

**Community Collections (tied to participation):**
- "Voice" -- posted 50 discussion comments across projects
- "Megaphone" -- shared projects that brought in 100+ new backers
- "Architect" -- proposed 3+ projects that went live
- "Bridge Builder" -- active member in 5+ communities

**Milestone Collections (tied to consistency):**
- "Early Adopter" -- joined in Year 1
- "Year of Rain" -- contributed every month for 12 months
- "Cascade Collection" -- part of 5 fully-funded projects
- "Full Circle" -- followed a project from proposal to completed impact report

**Loan Funder Collection (tied to microloan funding and outcomes):**

Loan funding has its own progression arc: the first contribution, the waiting period, the repayment, the recycling. These badges make that journey legible and rewarding. Layered from immediate (earnable in days) to long-term (months or years) so funders have something to work toward during the waiting periods between funding and repayment.

*Early (days to weeks):*
- "First Handshake" -- funded your first microloan
- "Believer" -- funded a first-time borrower (Tier 1, no repayment history)

*Mid-term (weeks to months, during repayment):*
- "Pulse Check" -- received a borrower update on a loan you funded
- "Halfway There" -- a loan you funded reached 50% repayment

*Outcome (months, after repayment):*
- "Full Circle" -- a loan you funded was repaid in full and capital returned to your watershed
- "Recycler" -- redeployed returned loan capital to a new loan
- "Triple Cycle" -- same watershed capital deployed through 3 loan cycles

*Deep impact (long-term, requires credit bureau reporting -- Phase 3-4):*
- "Credit Builder" -- funded a loan where the borrower voluntarily reported a credit score increase
- "Stepping Stone" -- funded a borrower who later qualified for a conventional loan using Deluge-built credit history

*Resilience (situational):*
- "Steady Hands" -- a loan you funded defaulted, and you funded another loan afterward
- "Patience Rewarded" -- a loan you funded defaulted, then the borrower recovered and your capital eventually returned
- "Comeback Backer" -- funded a borrower who previously defaulted and recovered

---

### Challenges

Challenges are collective, not competitive. The community works toward shared goals. Individuals contribute however they can -- cash contributions, ad-funded project contributions, sharing, promoting.

**Monthly Community Challenges:**
- Example: "March for Education" -- platform goal of funding 5 education projects this month
- Progress bar shows collective community effort
- Everyone who participates (cash contribution, ad watching, or promotion) gets a challenge badge
- Bonus: if the goal is hit, Deluge matches 5% on next month's impact allocations

**Consistency Challenges:**
- "30-Day Flow" -- contribute or watch ads every day for 30 days
- "Bring a Friend Month" -- invite someone new who makes their first contribution
- "Discussion Month" -- comment on 10 different projects
- Individual goals, individual pace -- no competition against other users

**Seasonal Events:**
- "Back to School" (August/September) -- education project spotlight, community rallies
- "Earth Month" (April) -- environment project spotlight, collective impact goal
- "Giving Season" (November/December) -- all categories, year-in-review, impact celebration

**What you won't see:** "Give more than your friend" or "Who can give the most this month?" Challenges are about showing up and participating, not outspending each other.

---

## UI Components

### Progress Bars (Water-Filled)

Project funding visualized as water filling a container:

| Progress | Visual |
|----------|--------|
| 0-25% | Small puddle forming |
| 26-50% | Water rising |
| 51-75% | Approaching overflow |
| 76-99% | Trembling at edge |
| 100% | CASCADE animation -- water spills over |

### Project/Impact Cards

- Rounded corners (8px radius)
- Subtle shadow for depth
- Water texture overlay (subtle)
- Category-coded colored borders
- Hover: gentle ripple animation, slight elevation increase, blue glow

### Buttons

**Primary CTA:**
- Deep Ocean Blue background
- Foam White text
- Ripple effect on click
- Slight scale on hover

**Secondary:**

## Give Tab Architecture

The Give tab is the hub for all non-cash contribution pathways. It's where users go to donate their attention, discover local businesses, and invite friends. Cash contributions happen through the dashboard and project detail pages. The Give tab is for everything else.

### What Lives in the Give Tab

| Belongs Here | Does NOT Belong Here |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Video ad watching | Cash contributions |
| Local business browsing | Impact dashboard |
| Referral sharing | Project discovery (that's the Discover tab) |
| | Impact tracking (that's My Impact tab) |

### Information Hierarchy

**Level 1: Today's Combined Impact (always visible at top)**

A persistent summary bar at the top of the Give tab showing combined progress across all pathways:

| Element | Display | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Today's total funded | Hero number | "Funded $0.068 today" |
| Breakdown | Expandable on tap | "$0.036 from ads + $0.024 from browsing + $0.008 corporate match" |
| Active project | Project receiving contributions | "Funding: Denver Youth STEM Lab" |
| Change project | Tap to switch | Navigates to project selector |

The combined number is the emotional anchor -- users see one total impact number, not four fragmented ones. The breakdown is available on tap for users who want the detail.

**Level 2: Four Contribution Sections**

Below the summary bar, four sections appear in a card-based layout. Each card shows today's progress and a primary action button.

| Section | Card Summary | Primary Action |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Watch Ads** | "3 of 10 today -- $0.036 funded" | "Watch next ad" |
| **Browse Local** | "12 businesses viewed -- $0.024 funded" | "Start browsing" |
| **Invite Friends** | "8 friends joined -- $18.50 earned" | "Invite a friend" |

Section order is fixed: Watch Ads and Browse Local are the daily-use features (top), Invite Friends is an occasional-use feature (bottom). All three sections are visible on a single scroll -- no sub-tabs or nested navigation. This avoids the "hidden feature" problem where users don't know a pathway exists because it's behind a tab they never tap.

**Level 3: Section Detail (on tap)**

Tapping a section card expands into the full experience for that pathway (detailed in the flow-specific sections below).

### Section Card Details

**Watch Ads card:**
- Daily progress ring (X of 10)
- Today's funded amount from ads
- Current streak count
- "Watch next ad" CTA (or "Done for today" if cap reached)

**Browse Local card:**
- Businesses viewed today
- Today's funded amount from browsing
- Number of businesses near the user
- "Start browsing" CTA
- **Geographic availability:** In markets without local business listings, this card shows: "Coming soon to your area. Want to help? Invite a local business to list." with a share link. Visible but clearly marked as upcoming -- not hidden, because hiding it removes the opportunity for users to share it with businesses they know.

**Invite Friends card:**
- Friends joined through referrals (total count)
- Total watershed credits earned from referrals
- Referral slots remaining this month (X of 10)
- "Invite a friend" CTA

### Corporate Match Banner

When a corporate matching campaign is active for the user's selected project, a banner appears between the summary bar and the section cards:

"**5x match active!** [Company Name] is matching ad contributions to [Project Name]. Every ad funds $0.045 instead of $0.009."

The match indicator is prominent but not intrusive -- informational, not pressure. When no match is active, the banner is absent (not "no match available" -- that implies they're missing out).

### Bottom Navigation Bar

The Give tab sits in the app's main bottom navigation:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Home** | Dashboard (My Giving + My Impact) |
| **Discover** | Project discovery, community feeds, trending |
| **Give** | All non-cash contribution pathways |
| **Profile** | Settings, achievements, referral dashboard, my loans |

The Give tab icon uses the raindrop motif. A small badge on the icon shows available actions (e.g., a dot if ads are available).

---

## Home Tab Architecture

The Home tab is the default view when a user opens the app. It contains the personal dashboard -- the user's giving and impact experience. Everything here is about "how am I doing?" before "what else is happening?"

### What Lives in the Home Tab

| Belongs Here | Does NOT Belong Here |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Impact summary and watershed balance | Project discovery feeds |
| My Giving tab (contributions, impact, projections, goals) | Community pages |
| My Impact tab (watershed, projects backed, loans funded, impact timeline) | Ad watching or business browsing |
| Borrower dashboard ("My Loan" section for active borrowers) | Referral management |
| Private milestones | Community progress (separate page) |
| Impact cards | Achievement browsing |
| Quick-action row (Add funds, Watch ads, Explore projects) | |

### Information Hierarchy

**Level 1: Impact hero number (always visible)**

The first thing a user sees: total impact deployed and watershed balance. Large, bold, prominent. This anchors the giving experience.

**Level 2: Two-tab switcher (My Giving / My Impact)**

Sits just below the hero number. Both tabs share the same top-level impact context.

- **My Giving** (default): Contribution history, watershed balance, projection tools, private goals, impact cards. See "Contribution History" and "Projection Tools" sections for full detail.
- **My Impact**: Watershed balance, aggregate impact metrics, project-by-project breakdown with outcomes, loan tracking with share repayment progress, impact timeline. See "Personal Impact Identity" section for full detail.

**Level 3: Borrower dashboard (conditional)**

If the user has an active loan as a borrower, a "My Loan" card appears below the tab content:
- Current balance, next payment due, payment history
- Credit progression status (current tier, next tier)
- Goal verification status (if applicable)
- This section only appears for active borrowers -- it doesn't clutter the experience for non-borrowers

**Level 4: Quick actions**

A compact row of action buttons at the bottom of the dashboard:
- "Add funds" -- navigates to cash contribution flow
- "Watch ads" -- navigates to Give tab, Watch Ads section
- "Explore projects" -- navigates to Discover tab

### Empty State (New Users)

New users see the watershed at $0.00 with a welcoming message, raindrop illustration, and two quick-action buttons ("Contribute now" and "Watch ads to grow your watershed"). No blank screen, no pressure. See "Personal Dashboard Design" for full detail.

---

## Discover Tab Architecture

The Discover tab is where users find projects, communities, and loans to back. It's the community-facing side of the app -- "what's happening?" and "what can I support?" Everything here is about discovery and exploration, not personal tracking.

### What Lives in the Discover Tab

| Belongs Here | Does NOT Belong Here |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Project discovery feeds (trending, near you, communities, almost there, new, following) | Personal impact dashboard |
| Loan discovery feeds (general, niche, regional) | Ad watching |
| Community pages and community feeds | Business card browsing |
| Project detail pages | Referral sharing |
| Loan detail pages | Personal impact tracking |
| Search | Settings |
| Cascade celebrations (platform-wide) | |

### Information Hierarchy

**Level 1: Discovery feeds (default view)**

A scrollable feed of project and loan cards, with feed filters accessible at the top:

| Feed | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Trending** | Projects and loans gaining momentum fastest right now |
| **Near You** | Projects and loans in the user's area |
| **Your Communities** | Activity from communities the user follows |
| **Almost There** | Projects close to their funding goal (cascade incoming) |
| **New** | Recently proposed projects and loan requests |
| **Following** | Updates from projects, people, and communities the user follows |

Feed filters appear as horizontal scrollable chips at the top. "Trending" is the default view. Project cards and loan cards appear in the same feeds, distinguished by their card type labels ("Project," "Microloan").

**Level 2: Search**

A search bar at the top of the Discover tab. Search across projects, loans, communities, and users. Results are grouped by type.

**Level 3: Community pages**

Tapping a community name anywhere in the app navigates to the community page within the Discover tab. Community pages show:
- Community description and member count
- Projects and loans associated with the community
- Community loan activity dashboard (see Community Progress section)
- Discussion threads
- Community milestones

### Project and Loan Cards

Project cards and loan cards share a common card format but are visually distinguished:

| Card Type | Label | Icon | Progress Bar | Key Metric |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| Grant project | "Project" | River/cascade | Water filling (one-way) | "$2,400 of $5,000 raised" |
| Microloan | "Microloan" | Cycle/loop arrow | Water filling with return arrow | "$340 of $500 funded" |

All card types navigate to their respective detail pages on tap.

### Cascade Celebrations

When a project reaches 100% funding, the cascade celebration appears as a banner at the top of the Discover tab for all users, in addition to push notifications to backers. See "Flow 4: Cascade Moment" for the full celebration UX.

---

## Profile Tab Architecture

The Profile tab is the user's personal settings, achievements, and history. It's where users manage their account, browse their badges, and see their full referral and sponsorship records. This tab is low-frequency -- users visit it occasionally, not daily.

### What Lives in the Profile Tab

| Belongs Here | Does NOT Belong Here |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Account settings (email, password, payment methods, notification preferences) | Impact dashboard (that's Home) |
| Achievement badges and collections | Project discovery (that's Discover) |
| Public profile preview | Ad watching (that's Give) |
| Referral stats dashboard (full history, milestones, earnings) | Daily impact tracking |
| Sponsor profile (if user has sponsored loans) | |
| Privacy settings | |
| Help and support | |

### Information Hierarchy

**Level 1: Profile header**

User photo, name, location, member since date. Quick stats: projects backed, communities joined, total impact deployed.

**Level 2: Sections (vertical scroll)**

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Achievements** | Badge grid organized by tier. Tap any badge for detail. Progress indicators on badges close to unlocking. Link to Collections. |
| **Referral Dashboard** | Friends referred (total and active), total watershed credits earned, monthly and lifetime slots remaining, per-referral milestone tracker. This is the full referral history view; the Give tab's Invite Friends card is just the action entry point. |
| **Sponsor Profile** | Sponsorship power, track record ratio, multiplier, sponsorship history with outcomes. Only visible if the user has sponsored at least one loan. |
| **Settings** | Notification preferences, privacy (public profile, contribution visibility), linked accounts. |
| **Help** | FAQ, contact support, report a problem. |

### Referral vs. Give Tab

The referral program appears in two places:
- **Give tab (Invite Friends card)**: The action entry point. "Invite a friend" button, referral link generation, share options. This is where users go to *do* a referral.
- **Profile tab (Referral Dashboard)**: The full history and stats. All referred friends, milestone progress, total earned, remaining slots. This is where users go to *see* their referral history.

The Give tab drives action. The Profile tab provides the record.

---

## Ad-Funded Impact Experience

Watching ads to fund community projects is a core engagement feature. Users who can't contribute cash can still contribute to the projects they care about by donating their attention. Individually, each ad generates a tiny amount -- but pooled across thousands of users, ad revenue becomes a meaningful funding stream for real projects. This is the raindrop-to-river metaphor applied to advertising revenue.

Ad earnings flow into the user's watershed. Every contribution -- whether cash or attention -- builds deployable impact capital that the user directs to grants or loans.

### First-Time Ad Watcher Onboarding

**Trigger:** User taps "Watch ads to fund projects" for the first time (from the payment screen, dashboard, or Give tab).

**Step 1: Educational overlay**

A 3-screen walkthrough that sets expectations honestly:

- **Screen 1 -- How it works:** "Advertisers pay to show you a 30-second video. We take a cut to keep the platform running, and the rest goes directly to community projects you choose." Simple flow diagram: Advertiser > Deluge (40%) > Your Project (60%).
- **Screen 2 -- What to expect:** "Each ad sends approximately $0.01 to a project. That's small per ad -- but when thousands of people watch, it adds up fast. 10,000 people watching 3 ads a day sends over $8,000 a month to real projects." Show a simple collective projection: one person, 100 people, 10,000 people.
- **Screen 3 -- Transparency promise:** "We'll always show you exactly how much the advertiser paid, how much Deluge kept, and how much went to projects. No hidden math."

**Step 2: Choose your project**

Before the first ad plays, prompt the user to select which project receives the revenue from their ad views. Show 3-4 trending projects with thumbnails and one-line descriptions. "You can change this anytime."

**Step 3: Consent screen**

Clear, concise data and privacy notice:

- "We share anonymized viewing data with ad networks (not your financial or personal data)."
- "You can stop watching ads at any time."
- Checkbox: "I understand how ad-funded impact works."
- CTA: "Start giving" (Deep Ocean Blue button)

---

### Ad Watching Flow

The step-by-step experience of watching an ad and funding a project.

**1. Entry point**

User taps the Watch Ads card in the Give tab (see "Give Tab Architecture" above for the full tab layout). The card shows daily progress, today's funded amount, current streak, and "Watch next ad" CTA.

**2. Pre-ad screen**

A brief interstitial before the video loads:

- Progress ring showing daily completion (3/10 filled)
- Estimated impact for completing today's remaining ads
- Current streak count and next streak milestone ("4 more days to 2-week streak!")
- "Ready?" button

**3. Tap to start**

- Loading state: water-droplet spinner with "Finding an ad for you..."
- Video player appears full-screen (or near-full-screen with a small Deluge header bar)

**4. Video plays**

- 30-second video ad
- No skip button -- the ad must be watched in full
- Minimal controls: mute toggle only
- Thin progress bar at top showing time remaining
- Deluge branding stays visible in header ("Funding [Project Name]...")

**5. Completion**

- Checkmark animation overlays the final frame
- Brief pause (0.5 seconds), then transition to the crediting screen

**6. Crediting screen**

This is the key moment -- see "The Crediting Experience" below for full detail.

**7. Post-credit prompt**

- "Watch another?" button with updated progress (4/10)
- "Done for now" option (no guilt, no pressure)
- If daily cap reached, celebratory completion screen instead

---

### The Crediting Experience

This is the most important screen in the ad flow. It's the moment the user sees their attention convert into real project funding. The emphasis is on the collective -- your contribution joining others to build something real.

**The transparency animation (2-3 seconds):**

1. Top line appears: "Advertiser paid **$0.015**" (full ad revenue, shown in Storm Gray)
2. Split animation: the amount divides into two streams flowing downward
3. Left stream: "Deluge keeps **$0.006**" (40% -- platform operating cost, shown in Storm Gray with a small "keeps the lights on" label)
4. Right stream lands with emphasis: "**$0.009 to [Project Name]**" (60% -- shown in Sky Blue #42A5F5, the hero number)

No secondary split. The full user portion goes to the project. Simple, clean, honest.

**Running totals update live:**

Two counters at the bottom of the screen tick upward as the credit lands:

| Counter | Label | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Today's contribution | "Funded today" | $0.027 > $0.036 |
| Project total | "[Project Name]" | $2.31 > $2.319 |

**Collective context:**

Below the counters, show the pooled impact: "437 people have watched ads for this project today -- **$38.21 funded so far this week.**" This is where the individual-to-collective shift happens. Your $0.009 is a drop. But you're one of hundreds, and together it's real money.

**Micro-celebration:**

- Drop sound effect (from brand sound design)
- Ripple animation emanates from the project contribution amount
- "+$0.009" floats upward toward the project name and fades (Sky Blue)
- Subtle but satisfying -- not over-the-top

**"Watch another?" prompt:**

- Progress bar updates: "4 of 10 today"
- "Watch another" button (primary, Deep Ocean Blue)
- "Done for now" link (secondary, no guilt language)
- If this was ad 10/10: "You've done your part for today!" with a completion animation (see Edge Cases)

---

### Local Business Card Browsing

Alongside video ads, users can browse local business cards to fund community projects. This is a lower-value-per-view, higher-volume interaction that doubles as a local business discovery tool.

**"Discover local businesses. Every view funds your community."**

#### Entry Point

User taps the Browse Local card in the Give tab (see "Give Tab Architecture" above). The card expands into a card stack or scrollable grid of nearby businesses, sorted by proximity and category. A small counter at the top: "Browsing funds projects -- $0.42 funded today from your views."

#### Business Card Format

Each card is a simple, non-video unit:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Business name | Prominently displayed |
| Category | e.g., "Coffee Shop," "Plumber," "Bookstore" |
| Location | Address or neighborhood name |
| Photo | One photo (storefront, product, team -- business owner's choice) |
| Description | 50 words max. What they do, why they're worth visiting. |
| Sponsored project (optional) | "Views fund Lincoln Elementary's garden" -- if the business has linked to a specific project |

Cards are designed to look like community bulletin board postings, not glossy advertisements. Authentic and local, not corporate.

#### Browsing Flow

1. **Open Browse Local section**
   - Cards appear in a swipeable stack or scrollable grid
   - Filter options: category, distance, "new this week"
   - Current project being funded displayed at top: "Browsing for [Project Name]"

2. **View a card**
   - Tapping or swiping to a card registers a view
   - Micro-credit animation: small "+$0.001" appears briefly near the project counter
   - Much subtler than the video ad crediting -- browsing should feel casual, not transactional
   - Counter updates: "$0.42 → $0.421 funded today"

3. **Interact with a card**
   - "Save" button -- adds to a personal saved businesses list
   - "Recommend" -- leave a brief note for other community members ("Great coffee, friendly staff")
   - "Directions" -- opens maps to the business location
   - "Share" -- share the business card with friends

4. **Browsing session end**
   - No daily cap on card views (unlike video ads)
   - User leaves whenever they want
   - Session summary available in the impact dashboard: "You browsed 34 businesses today, funding $0.041 to [Project Name]"

#### Business Submission Flow

For small business owners who want to list:

1. **Create a listing**
   - Business name, category, location
   - Upload one photo
   - Write a 50-word description
   - Optional: link listing to a specific community project ("Views of my card fund [Project]")
   - Free to create

2. **Basic verification**
   - Verify business location (address confirmation)
   - Verify business owner identity (same process as project proposers)
   - No quality review of the listing content -- the community decides what's useful via saves and recommendations
   - Target: 24-48 hour verification

3. **Dashboard**
   - Views this week/month
   - Saves and recommendations from community members
   - Community impact: "Your listing has contributed $47 to local projects this month"
   - Badge: "Supporting local projects through Deluge" -- downloadable for their storefront window or website

#### Crediting for Business Card Views

Much simpler than the video ad crediting experience -- browsing should feel organic, not like a transaction.

- No full-screen crediting animation per view (too disruptive for casual browsing)
- Running counter at top of the Browse Local section updates with each view
- Micro "+$0.001" animation near the counter (subtle, not blocking)
- Session totals shown when leaving the section or in the impact dashboard
- Corporate matching applies to business card views when campaigns are active (same as video ads)

#### Integration with Impact Dashboard

Business card browsing contributions appear alongside video ad contributions:

| Metric | Display |
|--------|---------|
| Cards browsed today | "34 businesses viewed" |
| Funded from browsing today | "$0.041" |
| Total funded from browsing this month | "$1.08" |
| Businesses saved | "12 saved to your list" |

The dashboard shows both video ad and business card contributions separately and combined, so users can see their total attention-funded impact.

---

### Ad Impact Dashboard

A dedicated view (accessible from the Give tab) that gives users full visibility into how their ad watching has funded projects.

**Daily progress section:**

- Water-filling progress bar toward 10-ad daily cap (styled as a container filling with water, 0-100%)
- Number of ads watched today vs. cap: "7 / 10"
- Today's total contribution with full transparency: "Funded $0.063 to [Project Name] today"

**Streak section:**

| Metric | Display |
|--------|---------|
| Current streak | "12 days" with flame or water-stream icon |
| Longest streak | "23 days" |
| Next milestone | "Watch 2 more days for a 2-week streak!" |

Streak is defined as watching at least 1 ad per day on consecutive calendar days.

**Monthly summary card:**

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Total funded this month | $1.89 |
| Projects supported | 2 |
| Ads watched | 210 |

**Historical chart:**

- Time-series bar or line chart showing daily or weekly ad-funded contributions over the past 1M, 3M, 6M, or ALL timeframes
- Toggle between "Contributions" and "Ads watched" views
- Color-coded by project (Sky Blue #42A5F5 primary, with distinct colors per project if multiple)

**Projects funded section:**

- List of all projects that have received funding from your ad watching
- Each entry shows: project name, total contributed from your ads, project status, collective ad funding from all users
- Tapping a project navigates to the project detail page
- This is the payoff: "Your ads have contributed $14.30 to Denver Youth STEM Lab. Combined with 892 other ad watchers, ads have funded $4,217 of this project."

---

### Edge Cases & Error States

Every error state should feel honest and human. No dark patterns. No guilt. No manufactured urgency.

**Daily cap reached:**

- Screen: "You've done your part for today!" (celebratory, not blocking)
- Show today's total contribution to projects
- Water-fill progress bar at 100% with a gentle shimmer animation
- "Come back tomorrow to keep funding." (encouraging, not demanding)
- Display: next streak milestone, collective progress on your chosen project

**No ad inventory:**

- Screen: "No ads available right now. Try again in a few minutes."
- Honest explanation: "Ad availability varies throughout the day. It's not you -- it's the ad networks."
- No countdown timer (we don't know when inventory will return)
- Suggest: "In the meantime, check out your impact dashboard or explore projects."

**Ad closed or interrupted mid-view:**

- Screen: "Ad wasn't completed -- no credit this time."
- Neutral tone, no punishment: "You can try again whenever you're ready."
- Progress stays where it was (no lost progress on previously completed ads)
- If network interruption (not user-initiated): auto-retry once, then show the above message

**Network issues:**

- If connection drops during ad load: "Couldn't load the ad. Check your connection and try again."
- If connection drops mid-view: cache the viewing state. If the ad completed before the drop, credit it when connectivity returns. If not, treat as interrupted.
- Never lose progress on already-credited ads -- all crediting is server-confirmed before updating local state

**Anti-fraud verification (CAPTCHA):**

- Triggered occasionally based on viewing patterns (not every session)
- Framing: "Quick verification" with a simple image or tap challenge
- Tone: matter-of-fact, not accusatory -- "Just making sure you're human. Tap the images with water."
- Failure: "Verification didn't pass. Try again or come back later." (no account penalty for a single failure)

---

### Ad Content Guidelines

Deluge reviews and controls the categories of ads shown to users. Users donate their time watching these ads to fund community projects -- the content should respect that exchange.

**Acceptable ad categories:**

- Consumer brands (retail, food, technology, entertainment)
- Financial services (banks, insurance -- not predatory lending)
- Education and career services
- Health and wellness
- Family-friendly entertainment
- Brands aligned with social impact, sustainability, or community themes

**Prohibited ad categories:**

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Gambling and sports betting | Conflicts with responsible financial behavior |
| Cryptocurrency speculation | Conflicts with responsible financial behavior |
| Scams, MLM, "get rich quick" | Exploitative, undermines trust |
| Adult content | Not family-friendly; Deluge is for all ages |
| Competitors (giving apps) | Direct conflict of interest |
| Predatory lending (payday loans, high-interest) | Contradicts mission of financial empowerment |
| Political ads | Divisive; Deluge is non-partisan |
| Tobacco and vaping | Health concerns |

**User controls:**

- "Report this ad" button available during and after every ad view
- Report categories: inappropriate content, misleading claims, offensive material, other
- Reported ads are flagged for review and blocked from showing to the reporting user immediately
- If an ad receives reports from 3+ users, it's auto-paused pending manual review

**Platform moderation:**

- Deluge pre-approves ad categories through the ad mediation platform (AdMob, ironSource, etc.)
- Quarterly review of ad category performance and user report trends
- Blocklist maintained and updated for specific advertisers and creatives
- Quality bar: prefer fewer, better ads over maximizing fill rate

---

## Personal Impact Experience

Promote the collective without forgetting the need to better the individual. The personal dashboard is where users see their impact accumulating, their contributions growing, and their community deepening -- before they ever look at the community feed. If we don't make the individual experience compelling, there is no collective.

### Personal Dashboard Design

The dashboard is what users see when they open the app. Impact and watershed balance are front and center. Community is one tap away, but the first thing a user sees is: "How am I doing?"

**Information hierarchy (top to bottom):**

1. **Watershed balance + total impact deployed** -- the hero number. Large, bold, Rain Gold (#FFA000). Example: "$34.20 available -- $187.35 total deployed"
2. **Personal impact summary** -- smaller but visible below. "Your contributions have helped serve 847 students across 4 projects."
3. **Community activity** -- compact feed preview. "3 projects you follow have new updates."

**Two primary tabs:**

| Tab | What It Shows | Default |
|-----|---------------|---------|
| **My Giving** | Contribution history, watershed balance, projections | Default view on open |
| **My Impact** | Impact dollars deployed, projects backed, outcomes, timeline | One tap away |

The tab bar sits just below the hero number so both views share the same top-level context.

**Empty state (new users, first session):**

- Watershed balance shows "$0.00" with a welcoming message, not a blank screen
- "Your journey starts here. Make your first contribution or watch an ad to fund a project."
- Illustration: single raindrop landing on still water, ripples forming
- Quick-action buttons: "Contribute now" and "Watch ads to fund projects"
- No pressure, no countdown -- just an invitation

**Established state (returning users):**

- Watershed balance and total impact animates in on load (counter ticks up to current value)
- Sparkline chart showing the past week's contribution activity below the hero number
- Quick-action row: "Add funds," "Watch ads," "Explore projects"
- Any unseen milestones trigger a gentle overlay (see Private Milestones)
- Notification badge on the My Impact tab if new project updates are available

---

### Contribution History

The My Giving tab gives users a full, interactive view of their contribution history. Designed to be informative without being overwhelming -- any user should be able to understand this at a glance.

**Contribution chart:**

- Time-series bar chart showing contributions over time
- Toggle buttons for time range: **1W** | **1M** | **3M** | **1Y** | **ALL**
- Touch/hover on any point to see the amount and date
- Bar color: Rain Gold (#FFA000)
- Clean, readable layout

**Key numbers (displayed above or beside the chart):**

| Metric | Display | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Total contributed | Large, bold | $187.35 |
| Watershed balance | Prominent | $34.20 available |
| This month | Smaller, below | $25.00 contributed |

**Contribution breakdown:**

- Horizontal stacked bar showing contribution sources (e.g., 70% cash / 20% ad revenue / 10% referral credits)
- Tapping a segment shows the detail for that source
- Clean, minimal

**Contribution timeline:**

- Bar chart or timeline showing contributions over time
- Monthly totals with the option to drill into individual transactions
- Helps users see their consistency ("I've contributed every month for 6 months")

---

### Private Milestones

**Philosophy:** Celebrate personal growth without competition. These milestones are PRIVATE -- they never appear on leaderboards, in community feeds, or on public profiles. They exist to reinforce consistent giving habits and mark meaningful moments in a user's journey.

This system is distinct from the public achievement badge system. Public badges celebrate community participation and impact engagement. Private milestones celebrate personal giving progress. The two systems do not overlap.

**Milestone categories:**

| Category | Examples | What It Celebrates |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| Consistency | 1-month giving streak, 3-month streak, 6-month streak, 1-year streak | Showing up regularly, regardless of amount |
| Total contributed | First $10, first $100, first $500, first $1,000 contributed | Growing your impact over time |
| Impact | First project funded, first loan repaid, first cascade | Seeing your contributions create real outcomes |
| Learning | Completed first learning module, finished beginner pathway | Growing your community knowledge |

**Important:** No milestone is tied to a specific dollar amount contributed in a single transaction. Milestones track cumulative contributions and cumulative impact, not spending. A user who reaches $100 through two years of small monthly contributions celebrates the same milestone as someone who contributed $100 on day one.

**Delivery:**

- Milestones appear as gentle in-app moments: a brief overlay when the user opens the app or navigates to the dashboard
- Visual: a quiet animation (raindrop landing, small ripple) with the milestone name and a one-line message
- Examples:
  - "Steady Flow -- You've contributed every month for 6 months. That consistency is building something real."
  - "First Hundred -- You've contributed $100 total. Every drop adds up."
  - "Full Circle -- A loan you funded was repaid in full. Your watershed just grew."
- The user taps to dismiss or taps "Learn more" for context
- Once seen, milestones are logged in a private "My Milestones" section accessible from the dashboard
- No push notification -- these are discovered naturally when the user opens the app

**Journey examples:**

| Timeframe | Possible Milestones |
|-----------|-------------------|
| First week | "First Drop" (public badge), first ad-funded project contribution (private), chose first impact project (private) |
| 3 months in | 3-month consistency streak (private), total contributions crossed $50 (private), completed beginner learning pathway (private), "Steady Flow" (public badge) |
| 1 year in | 12-month streak (private), total contributions crossed $500 (private), first loan repaid (private), "Year of Flow" (public badge) |

### Community Impact Education

Contextual education woven into the dashboard experience. Not a separate "learn" section the user has to seek out -- the learning comes to them, tied to real events in their giving journey.

**Contextual learning moments:**

Triggered by real platform events, these are short, educational messages that appear as expandable cards within the dashboard:

| Trigger | Learning Moment |
|---------|----------------|
| First project funded reaches completion | "The project you backed just reached its goal! Here's how your contribution joined others to make this happen." |
| First microloan repayment received | "You just received your first loan repayment! Your watershed grew because the person you backed is following through." |
| User has been active for 1 year | "You've been giving for a year. Here's the cumulative impact of your contributions..." with a visual showing total outcomes. |
| Community cascade milestone | "Your community just hit 10 cascades! That's 10 projects fully funded by people like you." |

**"Learn More" expandable cards:**

Persistent educational cards within the dashboard that users can expand at their own pace:

- **What is a watershed?** -- "Your watershed is your personal impact fund. Contributions flow in, and you deploy them to projects and loans..."
- **What is a microloan?** -- "Microloans let you fund individuals directly. If they repay, the money returns to your watershed to be deployed again..."
- **What is a cascade?** -- "When a project reaches 100% funding, it cascades. That means the community collectively made it happen..."
- **How does impact get measured?** -- "Every project reports outcomes: students served, trees planted, businesses launched. Your share is proportional to your contribution..."

Cards appear contextually (the watershed card appears on first visit; the microloan card appears when a user first views a loan).

**Learning pathway:**

| Level | Name | Criteria | What It Means |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Beginner | Signed up, contributed, read 0-2 cards | Just getting started |
| 2 | Comfortable | Read 5+ learning cards, active 3+ months | Understanding the basics |
| 3 | Confident | Completed all core learning modules, active 6+ months, used projection tools | Solid community foundation |

Progress is tracked privately in the user's profile. There is one optional public connection: completing the beginner pathway unlocks a "Community Literacy" badge in the public achievement system. This is the only bridge between private learning progress and public recognition.

**Content source:**

Learning content lives IN the app experience (not external links). It connects to Deluge's blog and content strategy but is delivered as native UI cards, not web views. Content is written in plain language at a high-school reading level. No jargon without explanation.

### Personal Impact Identity ("My Impact" View)

The second tab on the dashboard. While "My Giving" shows contribution history, "My Impact" shows the real-world outcomes of the user's participation. This is the emotional core of the experience.

**Your Watershed (hero element):**

At the top of the My Impact tab sits the user's watershed -- their personal impact fund balance. The watershed is where impact capital collects before being deployed to projects or loans. It's visualized as a pool of water, with the current balance displayed prominently.

Money flows INTO the watershed from five sources:

| Source | How It Gets There |
|--------|------------------|
| Cash contributions | 100% of every cash contribution |
| Ad-funded contributions | 100% of the user's ad revenue share ($0.009/ad at base), amplified by corporate matching when active |
| Referral credits | Vesting credits earned by referring new active users ($2.50-3.00 per referral) |
| Loan repayments | Principal returned from microloans via share-based repayment |

Money flows OUT of the watershed to two types of projects:

| Destination | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| Grants | One-way. Funds a project directly. Money does not return. |
| Microloans | Circular. Funds a borrower. If repaid, principal returns to your watershed. May not return (disclosed risk). |

The watershed balance is what the user has available to deploy at any time. A user who funds loans and gets repaid grows their watershed over time without contributing additional cash -- their impact capital regenerates. This is the water cycle: rain falls, flows out, some returns, collects, flows out again.

Watershed display example: "Your Watershed: **$34.20 available**" with a water-pool animation that rises and falls as funds flow in and out.

**Aggregate impact view (below watershed):**

| Metric | Display | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Total impact dollars deployed | Hero number | "$187.35 to projects and loans" |
| Number of projects backed (grants) | Count with icon | "5 projects" |
| Number of people backed (loans) | Count with icon | "3 loans" |
| Communities joined | Count with icon | "3 communities" |

**Project-by-project breakdown:**

A scrollable list of every project and loan the user has funded, showing:

| Field | Grant Example | Loan Example |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Name | "Denver Youth STEM Lab" | "Maria's Bakery Equipment" |
| Your contribution | "$43.20 ($38.70 from cash + $4.50 from ads)" | "$20.00 from watershed" |
| Status | "In progress -- 78% funded" or "Completed" | "Repaying -- 4 of 10 payments made" |
| Outcome metric | "Serving 312 students so far" | "Bakery open, 2 employees hired" |
| Return status | -- | "42 of 80 shares repaid ($10.50 of $20.00)" |

Tapping a project navigates to the full project detail page. Tapping a loan navigates to the loan detail page with repayment progress.

**Outcome metrics tied to YOUR money:**

Where possible, show impact metrics scaled to the user's contribution relative to the project or loan total:

- "Your contributions helped serve 847 students" (calculated proportionally from the user's share of total project funding)
- "You helped protect 2.3 acres of forest" (proportional to contribution)
- "Your loan helped Maria open her bakery and hire 2 employees"
- These numbers are approximate and labeled as such: "Based on your share of project funding"

This makes the impact feel personal without creating competition around dollar amounts. A user who contributed $5 sees a smaller but real number. A user who contributed $500 sees a larger one. Both matter.

**Timeline of your impact journey:**

A vertical timeline showing the user's impact milestones in chronological order:

- "Jan 15 -- Backed 'Denver Youth STEM Lab' ($25 grant)"
- "Feb 3 -- First project update received: 'Lab equipment arriving!'"
- "Feb 20 -- Funded Maria's bakery equipment loan ($20)"
- "Mar 20 -- Denver STEM Lab funded! (CASCADE)"
- "Apr 1 -- Maria made her first loan payment. $20 returning to your watershed."
- "Apr 8 -- Impact report: 312 students served in first month"
- "May 1 -- $20 returned to your watershed from Maria's loan. Ready to redeploy."

Each entry is tappable, expanding to show the full update, photos, or report. Loan repayment events are highlighted with the watershed icon to reinforce the water-cycle metaphor.

**Post-cascade updates:**

After a project the user backed reaches full funding and begins execution, updates flow back to the My Impact tab:

- Photos from the project site ("The lab is open!")
- Progress reports from the proposer
- Milestone announcements ("500th student served")
- Final impact reports with verified metrics

These updates are what close the loop -- the user sees their money turn into real outcomes. This is the emotional payoff that drives retention and continued giving.

**Watershed replenishment moment:**

When a loan repayment returns funds to the user's watershed, a dedicated notification and animation plays:

- Notification: "Your watershed just grew! $2.50 repaid from Maria's bakery loan (42 of 80 shares complete)."
- Animation: water flowing back into the user's watershed pool, level rising
- On final repayment: "All 80 shares repaid! Your $20.00 has fully returned from Maria's bakery loan. Fund another loan or back a project."
- These recurring moments reinforce the loan cycle -- the user sees their impact capital regenerate over time

---

### Projection Tools

A forward-looking calculator that helps users visualize what their current giving habits will produce over time. Accessible from the My Giving tab as a "See your future impact" card.

**"At your current pace" calculator:**

Based on the user's actual behavior (average monthly contribution, total impact deployed, time active), show a projection:

- "At your current pace of $15/month, here's the impact you could create:"
- Chart showing projected total contributions and estimated impact at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years
- Shows how watershed recycling (loan repayments) amplifies total impact beyond raw contributions

**Adjustable inputs:**

| Input | Default | Range |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Monthly contribution | User's actual average | $5 - $500 slider |
| Time horizon | 5 years | 1 - 20 years slider |
| Loan repayment rate | 90% (platform average) | Adjustable |

**Impact projection:**

The key differentiator: show how contributions compound through watershed recycling.

| Column | Example (5 years, $25/month cash contribution) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Your total contributions in 5 years | $1,500 in cash contributions |
| Your total impact in 5 years | ~$2,100 (contributions + recycled watershed from loan repayments + ad-funded contributions) |

If the user also watches ads, show the additional impact: "Plus, if you keep watching 5 ads a day, that's an additional ~$81 to projects over 5 years from ads alone."

This reinforces the value proposition: cash contributions create direct impact, and watershed recycling amplifies it further.

**Educational framing and disclaimers:**

- "These projections use historical market averages and are not promises of future returns."
- "Actual returns will vary. Markets go up and down. The projections show a range of possibilities."
- "Past performance does not guarantee future results."
- Disclaimers are visible but not overwhelming -- a single line below the chart, not a wall of legal text
- The tool is educational, not advisory. It helps users understand the power of consistency and compounding.

**Goal-setting:**

- "Set a goal" button lets users define a private giving target
- Inputs: target amount (e.g., "$5,000"), target date (e.g., "December 2030")
- The dashboard shows progress toward the goal: "42% of the way to your $5,000 goal"
- Goals are private -- never displayed publicly or used in any ranking
- Multiple goals allowed (e.g., one for total contributions, one for monthly contribution target)
- If the user's current pace won't reach the goal by the target date, gently suggest: "To reach your goal on time, consider increasing to $30/month" (suggestion only, never pressure)

---

### Individual-to-Collective Bridge

The personal dashboard is designed to be self-sufficient -- a user could use only the My Giving and My Impact tabs and have a complete experience. But the bridge to community should be natural and inviting, never forced.

**"Your drop in the river" visual:**

On project detail pages, show a visualization of the user's contribution within the project's total funding. A water-fill progress bar with a highlighted section: "Your contributions: $43.20 of $12,450 raised." The user's portion is color-highlighted within the fill, showing their drop within the river. This reinforces both individual agency ("I'm part of this") and collective power ("Look what we built together").

**Transition points from personal to community:**

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| My Giving tab | Community feed | "See what others are funding" link at bottom of giving view |
| My Impact tab | Project page | Tapping any project in the impact breakdown |
| My Impact tab | Community page | Tapping a community in the "Communities joined" section |
| Dashboard (any tab) | Trending projects | "Explore projects" quick-action button |
| Milestone achieved | Related community challenge | "Others are working toward similar goals -- see this month's challenge" |

**Unified notification stream:**

The notification bell balances personal and community updates:

| Type | Example | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| Personal impact | "Your total contributions crossed $1,000" | High (shown first) |
| Personal impact | "Project you backed posted an update" | High |
| Community activity | "Denver Community just funded a project!" | Medium |
| Platform announcements | "New learning module available" | Low |

Notifications are grouped by type and time, with personal updates always surfacing above community updates. The user can adjust notification preferences in settings.

---

## Microloan Experience

Grants fund projects. Loans fund people. Microloans let the community directly back individuals -- a person starting a bakery, buying tools for a trade, covering training costs -- with the understanding that if the borrower is responsible, the money comes back to be deployed again. If it doesn't come back, that's the risk the funder accepted.

### Funder Experience (Backing a Loan)

**Discovering loans:**

Loans appear alongside grant projects in the discovery feeds, clearly labeled. A loan card looks similar to a project card but with distinct markers:

| Element | Grant Card | Loan Card |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Label | "Project" | "Microloan" |
| Icon | River/cascade | Cycle/loop arrow |
| Progress bar | Water filling (one-way) | Water filling with return arrow |
| Key metric | "$2,400 of $5,000 raised" | "$340 of $500 funded -- 640 of 2,000 shares remaining" |
| Return note | -- | "Funds may return to your watershed if repaid" |

**Funding a loan:**

1. User taps a loan card, views the borrower's profile and loan purpose
2. Loan detail page shows: borrower name, verified identity status, loan purpose and category (general or niche), borrower location, total amount with stretch goals (stacked progress bar), funding deadline and time remaining, payment schedule, share price ($0.25), total shares in loan, shares remaining
3. User taps "Fund this loan"
4. Amount screen: "$0.25 minimum (one share). Fund any amount in $0.25 increments." Watershed funds come from cash contributions, referral credits, or recycled loan repayments -- users don't need cash on hand to build a watershed balance.
5. Funds come from the user's watershed balance
6. **Risk disclosure (mandatory, not skippable):**

> "This is a loan, not a grant. If the borrower repays, your contribution will return to your watershed a little at a time. If the borrower does not repay, some or all of your contribution may be lost. Deluge does not guarantee repayment. By funding this loan, you accept this risk."

7. User confirms. Funds leave their watershed and enter the loan.
8. Confirmation screen shows share count: "You funded 80 shares ($20.00). Based on the repayment schedule, your shares are estimated to be fully repaid by month 8."

**During the acceptance window (48-72 hours after funding resolves):**

After a loan is fully funded, the borrower has 48 hours to accept (auto-cancelled at 72 hours). During this window, funders see:

- Loan status: "Funded -- awaiting borrower confirmation"
- Their share count and estimated repayment timeline (same as after confirmation, since the share allocation is already set)
- No action required from the funder -- this is an informational state

If the borrower accepts: funders receive a notification and the cascade celebration fires. "Great news -- [Borrower] accepted their loan! Funds are being disbursed."

If the borrower declines or times out: funders receive a notification and their funds return to their watersheds. "[Borrower] did not proceed with their loan. Your contribution has been returned to your watershed."

**Tracking a funded loan:**

From the My Impact tab, funded loans show:

- Borrower name and loan purpose
- Repayment progress: "6 of 10 payments made"
- Share repayment progress: "42 of 80 shares repaid ($10.50 of $20.00)"
- Borrower updates (if the borrower posts updates -- encouraged but not required)
- Status: On time / Late / Defaulted

**Loan Q&A (structured questions):**

Loan pages have a lightweight Q&A section instead of full discussion threads. This gives funders a way to ask the borrower specific questions while keeping moderation burden low.

- Funders can submit a question on any loan they've funded or are considering funding (limit: 2 questions per funder per loan)
- Questions are short-form (280 character limit) -- specific and concrete, not open-ended discussion
- The borrower sees submitted questions and can optionally respond. Answering is encouraged but not required.
- Borrower responses are visible to all funders on the loan page
- Community members can flag inappropriate questions (off-topic, harassing, or privacy-violating). Flagged questions are hidden pending review.
- Deluge does not moderate every question -- community flagging handles most cases, with Deluge reviewing flagged items
- No threaded replies or back-and-forth. One question, one answer. If a funder needs clarification, they submit a new question (within their 2-question limit).
- Example questions: "What brand of oven are you looking at?" / "Is the welding certification through a specific school?" / "How far is the commute you need the car for?"

This is intentionally limited. Full discussion threads create moderation burden and can devolve into judgment of the borrower's choices -- which contradicts the principle that the community funds what it wants to fund, not what it approves of.

**When funds return:**

Your money comes back a little at a time. Each payment cycle, funders receive repayment on a portion of their shares -- small watershed replenishments throughout the life of the loan. Smaller contributions finish first (fewer shares to repay), larger contributions stay in the loan longer. Funders receive a notification on each repayment: "2 shares repaid ($0.50). 42 of 80 shares complete." When all shares are repaid, the final repayment triggers a completion celebration and animation.

### Borrower Experience (Taking a Loan)

**Who can apply:**

Anyone with a verified Deluge account. Deluge's mission is to give anyone a loan and build them up. The vetting process confirms identity and legitimacy, not creditworthiness in the traditional sense. People who can get conventional loans probably will -- the people coming to Deluge are the ones traditional lenders won't serve.

#### Loan Purpose & Eligibility

Loans are for personal growth -- any legal, reasonable purpose. Deluge does not judge whether a purpose is "worthy enough." The community (funders) decides what gets funded by choosing which loans to back. Deluge verifies identity and legitimacy, not purpose worthiness.

**Acceptable purposes (non-exhaustive):**
- Equipment for a trade or business
- Education, certifications, or training
- Transportation (car repair, bike, transit pass)
- Technology (laptop, tools for freelance work)
- Housing-related needs (deposit, move, furnishing)
- Personal development (any legal, reasonable goal)

**Prohibited purposes:**
- Alcohol or drug purchases
- Pornography
- Illegal activity
- Gambling

The borrower states their purpose and intended goal at application. Funders see this purpose and decide for themselves whether to fund the loan. Deluge's role is to verify the person is real and the purpose is legal -- the community handles everything else.

#### One Loan at a Time

A user may have one active loan at a time. This is the baseline rule. The borrower must repay their current loan (or default and recover) before taking a new one.

**Exceptions via sponsorship:**

- **Sponsor-upward:** Sponsor(s) can vouch to increase an existing active loan amount. The additional funds are disbursed, and the payment schedule is adjusted. Sponsorship power applies at full rate for sponsor-upward (same loan, lower risk). See "Sponsor-Upward" under Sponsorship below.
- **Concurrent loan:** Sponsor(s) can enable a second loan for a different purpose. Sponsorship power is halved for concurrent loan sponsorship (reflects higher risk of a borrower carrying two loans). Both loans follow standard rules independently -- payments, default, and credit impact are tracked separately. See "Concurrent Loan Sponsorship" under Sponsorship below.

**Applying for a loan:**

1. **Start a loan request**
   - Loan amount (platform sets tiers based on borrower history -- see Credit Progression below)
   - Purpose category: borrower self-selects from general or niche categories (see Loan Discovery below)
   - Purpose: what the money is for (specific and concrete -- "bakery equipment," "welding certification course," "laptop for freelance work")
   - Stretch goals (optional): up to 3 prioritized additions beyond the primary goal. Each stretch goal has a specific amount and purpose. Funding fills primary first, then stretch goals in priority order. Each stretch is all-or-nothing -- partially funded stretches return excess to funders' watersheds. (See Funding Deadline & Stretch Goals below.)
   - Repayment plan: proposed monthly payment amount and duration
   - Location: borrower's city/metro area (used for regional discovery)
   - Personal story (optional but encouraged): who you are, why this matters

2. **Identity verification**
   - Same verification process as project proposers: real identity, real person
   - Bank account verification for receiving disbursement and making repayments
   - No credit check, no income verification, no collateral

3. **Review and approval**
   - Deluge reviews for legitimacy (is this a real person with a real purpose?) -- not for likelihood of repayment
   - Deluge verifies the purpose category is appropriate (recategorizes if clearly wrong, e.g., a gaming loan listed as education)
   - Target review time: 48-72 hours
   - Rejection only for: unverifiable identity, fraudulent purpose, or prohibited categories (gambling, illegal activity)

4. **Loan goes live**
   - Appears in discovery feeds based on category (general or niche) and location (local, regional, national)
   - Borrower can share their loan request with their network
   - Funding progress visible in real-time, showing primary goal and stretch goals as a stacked progress bar
   - Funding deadline displayed prominently (see Funding Deadline & Stretch Goals below)

5. **Loan funded -- borrower acceptance required**
   - If primary goal is met (at deadline or before): the loan resolves. Any fully funded stretch goals are included. Unfunded stretch goal amounts return to funders' watersheds.
   - If primary goal is not met by deadline: loan is cancelled. All funds return to funders' watersheds. Borrower can reapply.
   - **Borrower must accept the loan before disbursement.** This applies to all loans, regardless of stretch goals. The borrower sees a Loan Agreement screen showing the final funded amount, repayment schedule, servicing fees, and credit bureau reporting terms.
   - The borrower has **48 hours** to accept or decline. A reminder is sent at 24 hours if no action is taken.
   - If the borrower accepts: funds are disbursed. Cascade celebration. Repayment schedule begins.
   - If the borrower declines: all funds return to funders' watersheds. The borrower is not penalized -- circumstances change, and declining is preferable to taking a loan you no longer need.
   - If the borrower does not respond within **72 hours**: the loan is automatically cancelled. Funds return to funders' watersheds. This prevents loans from sitting in limbo.
   - First payment due 30 days after disbursement

#### Funding Deadline & Stretch Goals

Every loan has a funding deadline. Loans that don't attract enough funders fail fast so the borrower can reapply with a different approach. Deadlines scale with loan tier because larger loans need more funders and more time to build community momentum.

**Base funding deadlines:**

| Tier | Max Amount | Base Deadline |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Tier 1 | $100 | 7 days |
| Tier 2 | $500 | 14 days |
| Tier 3 | $1,000 | 21 days |
| Tier 4 | $2,000 | 30 days |
| Tier 5 | $5,000 | 45 days |

**Sponsor-extended deadlines:**

An established sponsor (with sponsorship history) can vouch to extend the funding deadline if a loan is making progress but hasn't reached its primary goal. This signals confidence: "I believe this will fund -- give it more time."

- First extension: adds 1x the original deadline (doubles the remaining time from the original base)
- Second extension: adds 0.5x the original deadline (half of the first extension)
- Maximum 2 extensions per loan, each by a different sponsor
- Sponsors must have an established track record to extend (no brand-new accounts)
- A sponsor can only provide one extension per loan

| Tier | Base | 1st Extension (+1x) | 2nd Extension (+0.5x) | Max Total |
|------|------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Tier 1 ($100) | 7 days | +7 = 14 | +3 = 17 | 17 days |
| Tier 2 ($500) | 14 days | +14 = 28 | +7 = 35 | 35 days |
| Tier 3 ($1,000) | 21 days | +21 = 42 | +10 = 52 | 52 days |
| Tier 4 ($2,000) | 30 days | +30 = 60 | +15 = 75 | 75 days |
| Tier 5 ($5,000) | 45 days | +45 = 90 | +22 = 112 | 112 days |

**Early full funding:**

A loan closes immediately when it is fully funded -- meaning the total requested amount (primary + all stretch goals) has been reached, or the primary amount has been reached for loans without stretch goals. There is no reason to keep a fully funded loan open past that point.

For loans with stretch goals where only the primary is met but stretches are still outstanding: the loan remains open until the deadline. There is no option to close early. The borrower waits for the deadline to see the final resolution, then accepts or declines the full result during the acceptance window. This prevents borrowers from leaving potential stretch funding on the table and keeps the process simple -- one resolution point, one acceptance decision.

**What happens at resolution:**

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Loan without stretches, fully funded before deadline | Closes immediately. Moves to borrower acceptance. |
| Loan with stretches, all stretches fully funded before deadline | Closes immediately. Full amount moves to borrower acceptance. |
| Loan with stretches, only primary met before deadline | Stays open until deadline. At deadline, resolves per stretch goal rules below. |
| Primary not met by deadline | Cancelled. All funds returned. |

After resolution, the borrower accepts or declines the full resolved amount (see "Loan funded -- borrower acceptance required" above). There is no option to accept a partial amount -- the borrower commits to or declines the entire loan as resolved.

**Stretch goals:**

Borrowers can define up to 3 prioritized stretch goals beyond their primary funding target. Each stretch goal has a specific amount and purpose.

Example: borrower requests $800 total for a bakery.
- Primary: $500 (oven and basic equipment) -- this is the minimum viable loan
- Stretch 1: $200 (signage and branding) -- first priority if extra funding comes in
- Stretch 2: $100 (initial ingredient inventory) -- second priority

At deadline, the system resolves top-down:

| Raised | Primary ($500) | Stretch 1 ($200) | Stretch 2 ($100) | Loan Funds At | Returned |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| $400 | Not met | -- | -- | Cancelled | $400 |
| $500 | Funded | -- | -- | $500 | $0 |
| $600 | Funded | Not met ($100 short) | -- | $500 | $100 |
| $700 | Funded | Funded | -- | $700 | $0 |
| $750 | Funded | Funded | Not met | $700 | $50 |
| $800 | Funded | Funded | Funded | $800 | $0 |

Stretches are all-or-nothing. Either a stretch goal is fully funded or the excess returns to funders' watersheds. A half-funded stretch creates ambiguity -- $100 toward signage doesn't buy signage.

The share model handles partial funding naturally: if the loan funds at $500 instead of $800, fewer shares are needed. Trailing funders (last to contribute) get their contributions returned. First-in stays, last-in gets refunded.

The borrower's repayment terms are set after the deadline resolves, based on the actual funded amount. A $500 loan has different payments than an $800 loan.

#### Repayment Term Limits

Repayment terms are capped per tier. The maximum term reflects loan size -- smaller loans should resolve in months, not years. Longer terms mean longer repayment timelines for funders, which is acceptable (funders contribute without the expectation of return), but the terms should be transparent so everyone understands the timeline.

| Tier | Max Loan | Max Repayment Term |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| Tier 1 | $100 | 6 months |
| Tier 2 | $500 | 12 months |
| Tier 3 | $1,000 | 18 months |
| Tier 4 | $2,000 | 24 months |
| Tier 5 | $5,000 | 24 months |

The borrower proposes their repayment schedule at application within these limits. The term sets the number of payments, which determines the scheduled payment amount (loan amount / number of payments).

**Transparency for funders:** When funding a loan, the funder sees the full repayment timeline, including their share count and estimated repayment schedule. "You funded 80 shares ($20.00). Estimated full repayment by month 8 of 12." Funders should treat their contribution as a gift with hopeful repayment -- if it takes the full term or longer (due to refinancing), that's the deal they accepted. The term limits exist to prevent loans from stretching indefinitely, not to optimize repayment velocity.

**Making payments:**

Borrower sees a dedicated "My Loan" section in their dashboard:

- Current loan balance remaining
- Next payment due date and amount (scheduled payment + 2% servicing fee)
- Payment history with status for each (on time, late, missed)
- Credit progression status (current tier, next tier, requirements)

**Standard payment:**

- Borrower pays scheduled amount + fee. Example: $60 principal + $1.20 fee = $61.20
- $60 repays the next 240 shares in interleaved queue order, distributing small amounts across all active funders proportionally
- $1.20 goes to Deluge for loan servicing
- Confirmation: "Payment received. 240 shares repaid across [X] funders. [Y] payments remaining."

**Overpayment:**

- Borrower pays more than the scheduled amount
- Overpayment above the scheduled principal is fee-free
- The overpayment repays additional shares in interleaved queue order. Credit-forward applies only to sub-$0.25 remainders.
- Example: Borrower pays $76.20 ($61.20 scheduled + $15 extra, fee-free). $75 total principal repays 300 shares across all active funders. Any sub-$0.25 remainder enters credit-forward.

**Double payment (two payments in one period):**

When a borrower makes a second payment in the same pay period, they're prompted to choose:

> "You've already made this month's payment. What would you like to do with this one?"
>
> **Pay next month early** -- Counts as your [February] payment. The $1.20 servicing fee applies. Next payment won't be due until [March].
>
> **Pay down your loan** -- Goes straight to principal with no fee. Your next payment is still due [February], but your loan gets shorter.

The choice is presented with clear language about the fee implications so the borrower can make an informed decision. Sometimes breathing room matters more than saving $1.20. Sometimes finishing faster matters more. Deluge doesn't decide -- the borrower does.

**Credit-forward mechanics:**

Credit-forward holds sub-$0.25 remainders when a payment doesn't divide evenly into shares. This is a near-trivial edge case since most payments divide cleanly into $0.25 shares.

- The amount sits in credit-forward, fee-free, already cleared
- It combines with the next payment to fill additional shares
- No additional fee is ever charged on credit-forward amounts
- The credit-forward balance is visible to the borrower: "Credit toward next share: $0.15"
- At loan completion, any remaining credit-forward clears the final share(s)

#### Goal Verification

When the borrower fulfills the objective of the loan, they provide a single update showing the goal was met. This is trust-and-verify with community oversight -- not a strict audit, not an ongoing reporting burden. One update, one moment, one piece of closure for funders.

**How it works:**
- Borrower submits one verification update when the loan's stated purpose has been fulfilled
- Acceptable forms: photos, receipts, a written update, or a combination
- Community members (funders, sponsors) can view the submitted evidence
- Community can flag concerns if the evidence appears inconsistent with the stated purpose
- Deluge reviews flagged cases but does not proactively audit every loan
- This update triggers the "Pulse Check" badge for funders who backed the loan

**Verification depth scales with loan size:**

| Tier | Expectation |
|------|-------------|
| Tier 1 ($100) | Light touch -- a brief written update or single photo is sufficient |
| Tier 2 ($500) | A photo or receipt showing the purchase/goal |
| Tier 3 ($1,000) | Photo(s) plus a receipt or brief written explanation |
| Tier 4 ($2,000) | Receipts and photos documenting the outcome |
| Tier 5 ($5,000) | Comprehensive single submission: receipts, photos, and a written summary of how the funds were used |

**Consequence of failed verification:**
If Deluge determines (via community flags and internal review) that a borrower materially misused loan funds -- meaning the money clearly did not go toward the stated purpose -- the borrower's account is blocked from future loans pending investigation. This is a loan block, not an account ban: the borrower retains access to all other platform features. The trigger mechanism and review process for loan blocks is an open design question to be resolved before launch.

**Goal verification gates future loans:** A borrower cannot apply for a new loan until their previous loan's goal verification has been submitted. This ensures borrowers close the loop on their stated purpose before accessing more credit. The requirement is submission, not approval -- Deluge reviews flagged cases but does not hold up future borrowing pending verification unless there's a specific concern.

- If a borrower's previous loan is repaid but goal verification hasn't been submitted, the "Apply for a loan" flow prompts: "Before applying for a new loan, please submit your goal verification for [previous loan]. This helps your funders see the impact of their contribution."
- Special cases (hardship, lost documentation, loans where the purpose changed due to circumstances) can be escalated through Deluge's support structure. Support can waive the verification requirement on a case-by-case basis.

**Open design question:** Operational burden at scale -- what counts as "sufficient proof," how much review capacity does Deluge need, and what is the specific process for investigating and resolving a loan block? This needs real-world testing before locking in hard requirements. Start light, tighten if abuse emerges.

#### Loan Discovery: General, Niche, and Regional

Not all loan purposes appeal to all funders. A "help me buy my first car" loan resonates broadly. A "help me build a gaming setup" loan resonates strongly with gamers and not at all with others. The discovery system surfaces the right loans to the right funders without hiding anything -- every loan is always findable through search and direct links.

**Discovery hierarchy:** Location first, then category. Funders see local loans before distant ones, and general loans before niche loans (unless they've opted into a niche).

**General loans (surface in everyone's feed):**

Purposes with broad appeal. Most funders would at least consider these regardless of personal interests.

- Transportation -- first car, car repair, bike, transit pass
- Education -- certification, course, tuition, trade training
- Business/Trade -- equipment, tools, inventory, startup costs
- Credit Building -- explicitly taking a loan to build credit history
- Medical/Health -- dental, medical costs, prescriptions
- Faith/Community -- church events, community celebrations, cultural events

**Niche loans (surface via community group membership):**

Purposes that appeal to specific interest groups. Not hidden -- just surfaced to the funders most likely to care.

- Housing/Renter Assistance -- deposit, moving costs, furniture, rent bridge
- Technology/Gaming -- gaming equipment, PC builds, console setups
- Recreation/Hobbies -- sports equipment, hobby materials, creative projects
- Lifestyle/Personal -- cosmetics, fashion, fitness equipment, travel
- Pets -- veterinary, adoption costs, equipment

Community groups are the opt-in mechanism. Joining "Gamers United" subscribes you to the Technology/Gaming niche. Joining "Denver Locals" subscribes you to Denver-region loans. Joining "Pet Parents" subscribes you to the Pets niche. Community groups are both social spaces and feed filters.

**Regional layering:**

- Local (same city/metro area) -- primary boost in feed, shown first
- Regional (same state) -- secondary boost
- National -- no boost, but fully accessible
- The borrower sets their location at application. Funders see distance context on every loan card.

People are more likely to fund locally. Someone in Denver seeing "a Denver resident needs help with car repair" has a different emotional connection than the same loan from across the country. Regional filtering makes that connection natural.

**Feed composition (what a funder sees by default):**

1. Local general loans (highest priority)
2. Local niche loans (from opted-in community groups)
3. Regional general loans
4. Regional niche loans (from opted-in groups)
5. National general loans
6. National niche loans (from opted-in groups)

**Categorization and flagging:**

- The borrower self-categorizes their loan at application, selecting a general or niche category
- Funders can flag miscategorization if a loan is clearly in the wrong category (e.g., a gaming loan listed as "education")
- Flagged loans are reviewed by Deluge and recategorized if needed -- moved to the correct category, not penalized
- Miscategorization is not punished because it's usually counterproductive anyway: a gaming loan miscategorized as education will fund worse because education funders don't relate to it
- Loans can have multiple tags (e.g., "laptop for freelance work" is both Technology and Business) and will surface in multiple feeds

**The general list is not permanent.** As the platform grows, community norms evolve. If a niche category consistently gets funded by broad audiences (not just opted-in group members), it can graduate to general. If a general category stops resonating broadly, it can move to niche. Deluge reviews this based on funding patterns.

**Key constraint:** Platform-level prohibited categories (alcohol, drugs, pornography, illegal activity, gambling) are always enforced regardless of category, community group, or region. No community group can override prohibited purposes.

### Credit Progression

Loan repayment history builds toward eligibility for larger future loans. This is the "building people up" mechanic -- Deluge isn't just giving someone a loan, it's helping them build a track record that didn't exist before.

**Loan tiers:**

| Tier | Max Loan Amount | Requirement |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Tier 1 | $100 | Verified Deluge account |
| Tier 2 | $500 | 1 loan repaid in full, on time |
| Tier 3 | $1,000 | 2 loans repaid in full, no more than 1 late payment total |
| Tier 4 | $2,000 | 3+ loans repaid in full, strong repayment history |
| Tier 5 | $5,000 | Established track record, community standing |

Tiers are displayed to the borrower as progression, not restriction: "You're Tier 1. Repay this loan on time and you'll unlock Tier 2 ($500 max)."

**What affects progression:**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| On-time payments | Positive -- builds toward next tier |
| Early repayment | Positive -- demonstrates responsibility, accelerates tier progression |
| Late payments | Negative -- delays tier progression (does not reduce current tier) |
| Default | Credit is halved after recovery (see Credit Rehabilitation). Borrower rebuilds from the reduced amount. |

**What does NOT affect progression:**

- Dollar amount of loans taken (a $50 loan repaid on time counts the same as a $200 loan)
- Number of funders who backed the loan
- How long the borrower has been on the platform (time alone doesn't unlock tiers)

Credit progression is visible to funders on the loan detail page: "Tier 2 borrower -- 1 previous loan repaid in full." This helps funders assess risk without Deluge making creditworthiness judgments.

**Credit bureau reporting:**

Deluge reports microloan repayment history to major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax). On-time payments build the borrower's real credit score. This transforms microloans from a platform feature into a financial stepping stone -- a Tier 1 borrower with no credit history can build a reportable track record through Deluge, eventually qualifying for conventional loans like a mortgage or car loan. "I built my credit score through Deluge" is the story that changes lives.

This is displayed to borrowers prominently during the loan application: "Your repayment history will be reported to credit bureaus. On-time payments build your credit score."

**Voluntary credit score sharing:**

Borrowers can optionally share credit score improvements with their funders and the community. This is entirely voluntary -- Deluge does not access or display the borrower's actual credit score.

- Borrower enters a point increase (not their actual score): "My credit went up +22 points!"
- The delta is displayed on the loan detail page and in funder notifications: "[Borrower] reports their credit score increased by 22 points during this loan."
- Aggregated across the community: "Borrowers in this community have reported +340 total credit score points this quarter."
- No verification of the self-reported number -- this is a trust-based sharing feature, not an audited metric
- Funders who backed the loan receive the update, reinforcing the emotional payoff of loan funding
- The "Credit Builder" badge (in the Loan Funder Collection) is tied to this: a funder earns it when a borrower they backed voluntarily reports a credit score increase

#### Credit Rehabilitation After Default

When a loan exits default (via recovery -- see Default Recovery below), the borrower's available credit is halved. This is the consequence: proportional, not permanent.

**Rules:**
- Credit is halved from whatever the borrower's current credit limit was at the time of default
- Always rounded down to the nearest $5
- Absolute minimum: $25 (a borrower always retains the ability to take a small loan -- enough to fund something real like a textbook, a tool, or a transit pass)
- The borrower rebuilds from the halved credit using normal tier progression rules

**Worked examples:**

| Credit Before Default | After Recovery (Halved) | Notes |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| $1,000 | $500 | Clean halving |
| $500 | $250 | Clean halving |
| $100 (Tier 1) | $50 | Clean halving |
| $50 | $25 | $25 is the minimum floor |
| $25 | $25 | Already at minimum -- cannot go lower |

Each successful repayment from the reduced credit rebuilds toward the borrower's previous tier. A borrower who was at $1,000, defaulted, recovered, and got halved to $500 uses normal progression from $500 to work their way back. The path back exists -- it just requires demonstrating renewed responsibility.

---

### Sponsorship (Community-Backed Credit Extension)

When a borrower needs a loan larger than their current tier allows, the community can sponsor them. Sponsors don't fund the loan -- they extend the borrower's credit ceiling so the loan can exist. The funders who deploy watershed funds into the loan bear the financial risk. Sponsors bear reputational risk: their name and track record are attached to the outcome.

**How sponsorship works:**

1. Borrower applies for a loan above their tier limit (e.g., Tier 2 borrower wants a $800 loan, $300 above their $500 max)
2. The loan enters a "seeking sponsors" state, visible to the community
3. Community members can sponsor the borrower, each adding credit based on their sponsorship power
4. Once enough sponsors have covered the gap, the loan can proceed to funding
5. Sponsors are listed on the loan detail page (with consent): "Sponsored by Alex, Jordan, and 2 others"

**Sponsorship power:**

A sponsor's credit extension power is based on two factors:

- **Base:** their total platform contributions (all cash contributed + impact deployed + ad contributions)
- **Multiplier:** their sponsorship track record, which can grow up to 200% of base

**Multiplier = track record ratio × (100% + volume bonus), capped at 200%**

- **Track record ratio** = total repaid sponsored loan value / total completed sponsored loan value. Aggregated across the sponsor's entire history of sponsorships. A single default against a large track record barely moves the needle. A default against a thin track record has significant impact.
- **Volume bonus** = grows with total successful sponsorship value, up to +100%. The more you've successfully sponsored, the higher your multiplier can go.

**Sponsorship power = base contributions × multiplier**

Example:

| Sponsor | Base Contributions | Track Record | Volume Bonus | Multiplier | Sponsorship Power |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| New sponsor | $2,000 | 100% (no history) | 0% | 100% | $2,000 |
| Active sponsor | $3,000 | 100% ($5K repaid) | +50% | 150% | $4,500 |
| Veteran sponsor | $5,000 | 98% ($20K repaid) | +100% | 198% | $9,900 |
| Sponsor with defaults | $3,000 | 75% ($1.5K of $2K) | +20% | 90% | $2,700 |

**Default recovery (2-for-1 aggregate counteraction):**

When a sponsored loan defaults, the sponsor's track record ratio drops proportionally. To recover, the sponsor must successfully sponsor loans totaling 2x the defaulted amount in aggregate. Any combination of loan sizes counts -- two loans matching the defaulted amount, four loans at half the amount, or any other combination that totals 2x.

Example: sponsor backed a $500 loan that defaulted. To counteract:

| Recovery Path | Valid? |
|--------------|--------|
| 2 × $500 loans repaid | Yes (2x = $1,000) |
| 1 × $1,000 loan repaid | Yes (2x = $1,000) |
| 4 × $250 loans repaid | Yes (2x = $1,000) |
| 1 × $400 + 1 × $600 repaid | Yes (2x = $1,000) |

Recovery sponsorships both counteract the default (restoring the track record ratio) AND contribute to volume bonus (growing toward 200%). The sponsor comes back stronger for having demonstrated renewed judgment.

#### Sponsor-Upward (Increasing an Active Loan)

A borrower has an active loan but needs more funds for the same purpose (scope grew, costs increased, opportunity expanded). Instead of taking a second loan, the existing loan can be increased through sponsorship.

**How it works:**
1. Borrower requests a loan increase through the "My Loan" section
2. The request enters a "seeking sponsors" state, visible to the community
3. Sponsors vouch for the increase, each contributing credit based on their sponsorship power
4. Once enough sponsors have covered the increase, additional funds are disbursed
5. Payment schedule is adjusted to reflect the larger loan amount
6. Sponsorship power applies at **full rate** for sponsor-upward (same loan = lower risk than a separate concurrent loan)

**Example:** Borrower has a $500 active loan for bakery equipment. Equipment costs $200 more than expected. Sponsors vouch for the additional $200. The loan becomes $700 (2,800 shares), payment schedule adjusts, and the additional funders' shares are added to the rotation.

#### Concurrent Loan Sponsorship

A borrower has an active loan and needs a separate loan for a different purpose. Sponsors can enable a second concurrent loan.

**How it works:**
1. Borrower applies for a second loan while their first is still active
2. The system flags this as a concurrent loan request -- requires sponsorship
3. Sponsors vouch for the borrower, but **sponsorship power is halved** for concurrent loan sponsorship (reflects the higher risk of a borrower carrying two loans simultaneously)
4. Once enough sponsors have covered the required credit, the second loan proceeds to funding
5. Both loans follow standard rules independently: separate payments, separate share rotations, separate default tracking
6. Hard cap: maximum 2 active loans at any time (1 baseline + 1 sponsored concurrent)

**Why halved power:** A borrower managing two loans simultaneously is higher risk than one managing a single loan. Halving sponsorship power means sponsors need to be more committed (or more sponsors need to participate) to enable a concurrent loan. This is a natural risk check.

**Default independence:** If a borrower defaults on one loan while a concurrent loan is active, the default does not affect the concurrent loan. Once a loan is funded, the funding is permanent -- there is no legal or mechanical basis to claw back or alter a separate funded loan. The defaulted loan follows standard default and recovery rules on its own. The borrower's credit limit is halved when (and if) the defaulted loan recovers, but that halving only affects future borrowing, not any currently funded loan. The borrower cannot take any new loans until the default is resolved -- the one-loan-at-a-time rule (plus the concurrent exception that already occurred) means they must deal with the defaulted loan before any further borrowing. Once the concurrent loan is repaid, the borrower's only path forward is resolving the default through recovery.

**Example:** Borrower has a $500 bakery loan and needs $300 for a separate welding certification. A sponsor with $4,500 in sponsorship power can extend $2,250 toward the concurrent loan (halved from $4,500). If the $300 is within that range, a single sponsor could cover it. If not, multiple sponsors contribute.

#### Retroactive Recovery for Sponsors

When a sponsored loan exits default through the recovery process (3 consecutive payments or full payoff), the sponsor's track record is restored:

- The default is reclassified as "recovered" -- it no longer counts against the sponsor's track record ratio
- Counteraction credit (if the sponsor had already spent effort recovering from the default) is refunded -- the sponsor doesn't lose their counteraction progress
- The sponsor's sponsorship power recalculates to reflect the improved track record
- Notification: "Good news -- [Borrower]'s loan has recovered from default. Your track record has been restored."

This means sponsors aren't permanently penalized for a borrower who eventually makes good. The incentive structure rewards patience and continued sponsorship rather than writing off a default immediately.

**UX for sponsors:**

The sponsor's profile shows their sponsorship status as a positive, growing metric:

- "Your sponsorship reach: **$4,500**" (large, prominent)
- "Track record: 12 of 13 sponsored loans repaid" (supporting detail)
- "Multiplier: 150%" (for users who want the detail)
- Recent sponsorship history with outcomes

When a sponsored loan is repaid: "Great news -- [Borrower] repaid their loan! Your track record: 13 of 14. Your reach: $4,650."

When a sponsored loan defaults: "[Borrower]'s loan has defaulted. Your track record: 12 of 14. Your reach: $3,860. Sponsor $1,000 more in successful loans to fully recover."

The default notification includes the specific recovery target -- clear, concrete, achievable. Not a vague "your score dropped."

**Sponsor visibility on loan pages:**

Funders evaluating a sponsored loan can see:

- Number of sponsors and their combined credit extension
- Each sponsor's track record (e.g., "Sponsor 1: 98% track record, 20 loans sponsored")
- Whether the borrower earned their tier naturally or through sponsorship
- This helps funders make informed decisions: a loan backed by veteran sponsors with 95%+ track records carries different social signal than one with new sponsors

---

### Loan Default Handling

When a borrower misses payments, the process is firm but not punitive. The goal is to recover funds for funders while acknowledging that defaults are the disclosed risk everyone accepted.

**Late payment (1-30 days overdue):**

- Reminder notifications to borrower (gentle, not threatening)
- Loan status changes to "Late" -- visible to funders
- No additional fees or penalties (the 2% servicing fee is the only fee, ever)
- Funder notification: "[Borrower] has a late payment. Their loan is still active."

**Significantly late (31-90 days overdue):**

- More prominent notifications to borrower
- Loan status changes to "At risk"
- Funder notification with context: "This loan is at risk. Microloans carry the risk of non-repayment, which you accepted when funding."
- Deluge may reach out to borrower directly to understand the situation

**Default (90+ days overdue, no communication):**

- Loan status changes to "Defaulted"
- Borrower's available credit is halved if and when they recover (see Credit Rehabilitation After Default)
- All funders with unrepaid shares should expect to lose the remaining portion of their contribution. When you fund a loan, you should expect no return -- the opportunity is to help another person grow, with repayment as a hopeful outcome, not a guarantee.
- Those funders receive notification: "This loan has defaulted. Your remaining shares are unlikely to be repaid. The borrower may recover in the future, but you should consider your unrepaid balance gone. This is the risk of microlending, and you accepted it when you funded this loan."
- Funder's impact timeline records the default: "Jun 1 -- Loan to [borrower] defaulted. 38 of 80 shares unrepaid ($9.50 at risk)."
- **Sponsors' track records are updated:** the defaulted loan value is added to their completed total, reducing their track record ratio and sponsorship power proportionally. Sponsors receive notification with their updated reach and recovery target.
- Default is reported to credit bureaus, impacting the borrower's credit score
- Borrower is not banned -- they can recover from default (see Default Recovery) or rebuild from a halved credit limit. People's circumstances change, and a default doesn't make someone permanently unworthy of a second chance.

**Partial repayment before default:**

- Because shares are interleaved round-robin, all active funders have been repaid roughly the same percentage of their contribution at the point of default
- Smaller funders may have already finished (exited rotation), but all remaining funders share the loss proportionally
- There is no positional advantage -- risk is distributed equally. This is disclosed at time of funding.

#### Default Recovery

A defaulted loan is not the end of the road. Borrowers can exit default and resume their credit-building journey through one of two paths:

**Path 1: Three consecutive on-time payments**
- Borrower resumes making payments at the original scheduled amount (or the refinanced amount, if refinanced)
- Three consecutive payments must be on time (by the due date)
- During this period, the loan status is "recovering"
- After the third consecutive payment, the loan exits default and returns to "active" status

**Path 2: Full payoff**
- Borrower pays off the entire remaining balance in one payment
- Loan immediately exits default

**On exit from default:**
- Loan status changes from "defaulted" to "recovering" (during 3-payment path) and then to "active"
- Borrower's available credit is halved (see Credit Rehabilitation After Default above)
- Sponsors' track records are retroactively improved -- the default is reclassified as "recovered" and no longer counts against their track record ratio
- Remaining funders with unrepaid shares resume receiving disbursements as the borrower continues making payments. Recovery payments flow through the share rotation in normal order -- the same funders who were told to expect a loss may eventually be repaid if the borrower follows through. This is the upside of not permanently writing off a default.
- Credit bureau reporting is updated to reflect the recovery

**What recovery does NOT do:**
- It does not erase the fact that a default occurred -- the loan history still shows the default period
- It does not restore the borrower's full credit limit -- credit is halved
- It does not retroactively repay shares that were written off during the default period

#### Refinancing

A borrower can request refinancing to change their payment amount or extend their repayment term. Refinancing is a support tool -- it exists to help borrowers avoid default or recover from it, not as a revenue mechanism.

**When refinancing is available:**
- Only for loans with a remaining balance of $1,000 or more. Below $1,000, the loan is small enough that the original payment should be manageable -- the 3-payment recovery path or full payoff is the right tool, not refinancing.
- At any point during an active loan (before default)
- During default, to make the 3-payment recovery path achievable if the original payment was unaffordable

**Refinancing can exceed tier term limits.** The term caps (T1=6mo, T2=12mo, etc.) apply at origination, but refinancing is a recovery tool, not a new origination. If a Tier 3 borrower at month 16 of 18 needs to halve their payment, the term extends beyond 18 months. The alternative is default, which is worse for everyone. Funders already accepted that wait times can stretch -- refinancing is one of the ways that happens. Once funded, funding is permanent; the community doesn't get a veto on refinanced terms.

**How it works:**
1. Borrower requests refinancing through the "My Loan" section
2. Borrower proposes a new payment amount and/or extended term (may exceed original tier term limit)
3. A refinancing fee is charged (see business model for fee structure)
4. The refinanced payment amount becomes the new scheduled amount for all future calculations (fee basis, recovery payment target)
5. Share rotation order is not changed -- existing funders keep their shares and positions

**What refinancing changes:**
- Scheduled payment amount (can be lowered)
- Number of remaining payments (extended if payment is lowered)
- Servicing fee per payment (recalculated based on new scheduled amount)

**What refinancing does NOT change:**
- Total remaining principal (still owed in full)
- Share rotation order (funders keep their shares and positions)
- The fact that a refinancing occurred (recorded in loan history)

**Example:** Borrower has a $2,000 loan at $150/month but lost their job. They refinance to $80/month, extending the term. The refinancing fee ($10 minimum or 1% of remaining balance, whichever is greater) is charged. Their 3-payment recovery target (if in default) is now $80/payment, not $150 -- making recovery achievable on a tighter budget.

### Loading Screens

Instead of spinners, use stage-appropriate water animations:
- Early platform: raindrops falling
- Growing platform: streams flowing
- Scaled platform: rivers rushing

Animations evolve as the platform grows.

## Notification Strategy

Deluge uses three notification channels: push notifications, in-app notifications, and email. Each channel serves a different purpose. The goal is to keep users engaged without becoming annoying -- notification fatigue is a retention killer.

### Channel Roles

| Channel | Purpose | When to Use | When NOT to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Push notification** | Time-sensitive, high-value moments that warrant interrupting the user | Cascades, microloan repayments received, corporate match going live | Marketing campaigns, weekly digests, low-value updates |
| **In-app notification** | Updates the user should see next time they open the app | Achievement unlocks, project updates, community activity, referral milestones | Anything requiring immediate attention |
| **Email** | Detailed content, summaries, and content worth reading outside the app | Weekly digest, impact milestones, triggered campaigns, welcome series | Real-time events (too slow), minor updates (too noisy) |

### Push Notification Triggers

Push notifications are reserved for moments that feel worth interrupting someone's day. Every push should make the user glad they received it.

**Tier 1 -- Always push (high-value, time-sensitive):**

| Trigger | Message Example | Rationale |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Cascade on a project you funded | "The Lincoln Elementary project just cascaded! You were part of it." | Core emotional moment. Users want to know immediately. |
| Microloan repayment received | "$20 returned to your watershed from [Borrower]. Ready to fund someone new." | Money arriving is always worth a notification. |
| Corporate match campaign goes live | "5x match active right now. Your ad views are worth 5x for the next 48 hours." | Time-limited opportunity. Users who miss this lose value. |
**Tier 2 -- Push if user has opted in (valuable but not urgent):**

| Trigger | Message Example | Rationale |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Project you funded hits 75% / 90% | "[Project] is 90% funded. Almost there." | Builds anticipation. May prompt additional contribution. |
| Achievement unlocked | "You earned the [Badge Name] badge!" | Fun, but not time-sensitive. User preference matters. |
| Friend joined via referral | "[Name] just joined Deluge through your link!" | Social moment, but not urgent. |
| Contribution milestone ($100, $500, $1K) | "You just hit $1,000 contributed. You're making a real difference." | Milestone celebration. Some users love this; others find it patronizing. |

**Tier 3 -- Never push (in-app or email only):**

| Trigger | Channel Instead | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| New project posted in your category | In-app | Too frequent. Would become spam at scale. |
| Weekly digest | Email | Summary content belongs in email, not push. |
| Ad streak reminder ("Watch an ad to keep your streak") | In-app | Nudges via push feel manipulative. Show in-app on next visit. |
| Community discussion activity | In-app | Too frequent. Community feeds generate constant activity. |
| Platform announcements | In-app + email | Not personal enough for push. |

### In-App Notification Center

A notification bell (Home tab header) shows unread in-app notifications. Grouped by type:

| Group | Examples | Badge Count? |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Impact updates** | Project milestones, cascade celebrations | Yes |
| **Giving** | Contribution milestones, microloan repayments, watershed credit earned | Yes |
| **Social** | Referral milestones, community activity, friend achievements | No (too noisy) |
| **Challenges** | Challenge progress, achievement unlocks, leaderboard changes | No |
| **Platform** | New features, category launches, policy updates | No |

Badge count only shows for Impact and Giving notifications. Social and Challenge notifications appear in the feed but don't increment the badge -- this prevents notification fatigue from high-volume social activity.

### Frequency Capping

| Rule | Limit | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Max push notifications per day | 5 | More than 5 pushes/day triggers opt-out behavior. |
| Max push notifications per hour | 2 | Prevents notification clustering during active periods (cascade + achievement + referral all at once). |
| Minimum gap between pushes | 30 minutes | Ensures each notification has breathing room. |
| Corporate match pushes per campaign | 2 (launch + ending reminder) | More than 2 feels like advertising, not notification. |

If multiple notifications queue during a capped period, prioritize by tier (Tier 1 first), then by recency. Deprioritized notifications move to in-app only.

### User Notification Preferences

Accessible from Profile tab → Settings → Notifications.

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Push notifications | On / Off | On |
| Cascade alerts | On / Off | On |
| Giving updates (repayments, milestones) | On / Off | On |
| Achievement notifications | Push / In-app only / Off | Push |
| Corporate match alerts | On / Off | On |
| Social notifications (referrals, friends) | Push / In-app only / Off | In-app only |
| Email digest | Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Off | Weekly |
| Marketing emails | On / Off | On (with easy unsubscribe) |

**Quiet hours:** Users can set quiet hours (e.g., 10pm-7am) during which push notifications are silenced and held for morning delivery. Default: off.

### Email vs. Push Coordination

When both channels would fire for the same event:
- **Cascade:** Push immediately. Email in the next weekly digest (not a separate email).
- **Contribution milestone:** Push (if Tier 2 opted in). Dedicated milestone email with shareable card.
- **Microloan repayment:** Push immediately. No separate email (appears in weekly digest).
- **Referral milestone:** Push (if social opted in). Dedicated email only at the 5th and 25th referral.

General rule: push is for the moment. Email is for the summary or the shareable artifact. Don't send both a push and a dedicated email for the same event unless the email adds significant content (photos, shareable card, detailed breakdown).

## Moderation Framework

Deluge is infrastructure, not editorial. The platform verifies legitimacy and enforces safety -- it does not judge whether a project is "good enough" or whether a loan purpose is "worthy." The community decides what gets funded. Moderation exists to keep the platform safe, legal, and trustworthy -- not to curate.

### Moderation Principles

1. **Verify, don't judge.** Deluge confirms that people are real, organizations are legitimate, and purposes are legal. Whether something deserves funding is the community's decision.
2. **Community-first.** Users flag problems. The platform investigates. Most moderation starts with a community report, not platform surveillance.
3. **Firm, not punitive.** First-time violations get warnings. Repeated or severe violations get escalated. Nobody gets banned for a mistake.
4. **Transparent.** Users know what's allowed, what will happen if they violate a policy, and how to appeal a decision.
5. **Fast.** Flagged content is reviewed within 48 hours. Users aren't left in limbo.

### What Gets Moderated

| Content Type | Moderation Scope | Community Role | Platform Role |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Project proposals** | Legitimacy only | N/A (pre-publication) | Verify identity, organization, legality, funds traceability |
| **Loan requests** | Legitimacy + prohibited purposes | Flag miscategorization | Verify identity, reject prohibited purposes, recategorize if needed |
| **Discussion threads** | Safety + civility | Flag inappropriate comments | Review flagged content, auto-hide at threshold |
| **Loan Q&A** | Safety + relevance | Flag inappropriate questions | Review flagged questions, enforce 2-question limit |
| **Business card listings** | Legitimacy | Saves and recommendations signal quality | Verify business identity and address |
| **User behavior** | Platform integrity | Report spam, harassment, fraud | Investigate reports, apply account actions |

### Prohibited Content (Platform-Wide)

Content that is never allowed regardless of context, category, or community group:

| Category | Examples | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Illegal activity | Drug manufacturing, weapons trafficking, fraud schemes | Legal compliance |
| Hate and discrimination | Projects targeting groups based on race, religion, gender, orientation | Safety and mission alignment |
| Harassment and threats | Targeted abuse, doxxing, intimidation in discussions or Q&A | User safety |
| Deceptive practices | Fake identities, fabricated evidence, misleading project descriptions | Platform trust |
| Self-harm or violence | Content promoting harm to self or others | Safety |
| Sexually explicit content | Pornography, sexually explicit project purposes | Platform standards |
| Gambling and substances | Alcohol, drugs, gambling-related projects or loans | Mission alignment (financial wellbeing) |

Prohibited content is removed. The user receives a notice explaining what was removed and why. This list is not subject to community debate -- it's a platform safety decision.

### Reporting and Flagging

Every content type has a "Report" or "Flag" option. Reporting is anonymous to the reported user. Reports are never used as a competitive weapon -- mass-coordinated false reporting is itself a violation.

**How reporting works:**

1. **User taps "Report" on any piece of content** (project, comment, loan, listing, user profile)
2. **Selects a reason:**
   - Spam or fake
   - Misleading or deceptive
   - Inappropriate or offensive content
   - Harassment or threats
   - Fraud or scam
   - Prohibited category (illegal, hate, etc.)
   - Other (free text)
3. **Report is logged.** The content is NOT immediately removed (except in safety-critical cases -- see auto-moderation below).
4. **Reporter receives confirmation:** "Thanks for reporting. We'll review this within 48 hours."

**Auto-moderation triggers (content auto-hidden pending review):**

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 3+ unique reports on the same content | Content auto-hidden, queued for manual review |
| Report reason is "Harassment or threats" from 2+ users | Content auto-hidden immediately |
| Report reason is "Prohibited category" with "illegal" selected | Content auto-hidden immediately, escalated to priority review |
| Keyword pattern match (slurs, threats -- automated) | Content auto-hidden, queued for review |

Auto-hidden content shows: "[This content has been hidden pending review]" to other users. The content creator sees: "This content has been flagged and is under review. You'll be notified of the outcome within 48 hours."

### Moderation Tiers

| Tier | Who Handles | Response Time | Scope |
|------|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Tier 1: Community** | Users report/flag | Immediate (flagging is instant) | First line -- surfaces problems |
| **Tier 2: Automated** | System rules | Immediate | Auto-hide at flag thresholds, keyword detection, fraud pattern detection |
| **Tier 3: Platform Review** | Moderation team | Within 48 hours | Reviews flagged content, makes moderation decisions, applies account actions |
| **Tier 4: Escalation** | Senior staff / legal | Within 72 hours | Complex cases, legal threats, law enforcement referrals, policy edge cases |

Most moderation starts at Tier 1 (community flag) and resolves at Tier 3 (platform review). Tier 4 is rare -- reserved for legal issues, coordinated fraud, or cases where the right policy isn't clear.

### Account Actions

Account actions are progressive unless the violation is severe. First-time violations typically receive a warning. Repeated or escalating violations result in stronger actions.

| Action | When Used | Duration | Effect |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Warning** | First-time minor violation (inappropriate comment, mild policy violation) | N/A | Notification explaining the violation and policy. No restrictions. Record kept. |
| **Content removal** | Prohibited content, deceptive content, harassment | Permanent | Specific content removed. User notified with reason. |
| **Feature restriction** | Repeated violations in a specific area | 30-90 days | Blocked from specific feature (e.g., can't post in discussions, can't propose projects, loan block). Other features unaffected. |
| **Temporary suspension** | Serious or repeated violations | 7 or 30 days | Full account access suspended. User notified with reason and duration. Watershed balance frozen in place. |
| **Permanent ban** | Severe violations (fraud, threats, illegal activity) or pattern of repeated suspensions | Permanent | Account closed. Watershed balance returned to user. Impact contributions already deployed remain deployed. |

**What does NOT result in account action:**
- A project that fails to get funded (that's normal)
- A loan that defaults (that's a disclosed risk, not a violation)
- Unpopular opinions in discussion threads (as long as they don't violate the prohibited content policy)

### Moderation by Content Type

**Project proposals:**
- Moderated at submission (Deluge reviews for legitimacy before going live)
- Post-publication: community can flag concerns, Deluge reviews flagged projects
- Project removal is rare and reserved for fraud or misrepresentation discovered after verification
- A project that's merely unpopular is never removed -- the community decides what gets funded

**Loans:**
- Pre-publication review verifies identity and screens for prohibited purposes
- Community can flag miscategorization (Deluge recategorizes, no penalty to borrower)
- Loan purposes that are legal but controversial are NOT removed -- the community decides whether to fund them
- Verified misuse of loan funds (failed goal verification) results in loan block, not account ban

**Discussion threads and Q&A:**
- Community flagging is the primary mechanism
- Auto-hide at 3+ flags
- Moderator reviews hidden content within 48 hours
- Harassment, threats, and hate speech result in content removal + warning (first offense) or feature restriction (repeat)
- Vigorous disagreement is not harassment -- moderation does not police tone, only safety

**Business card listings:**
- Pre-publication address and identity verification
- Community signals quality through saves and recommendations
- Fraudulent listings (fake business, wrong address) are removed
- Low-quality listings are not removed -- the community ignores what isn't useful

### Appeals

Any user who receives an account action can appeal:

1. **Submit an appeal** through the Help section (Profile tab). Free-text explanation.
2. **Review within 7 business days** by a moderator who was not involved in the original decision.
3. **One appeal per action.** The appeal decision is final.
4. **During appeal:** the action remains in effect. A suspended user stays suspended while the appeal is reviewed. This prevents abuse of the appeals process to delay enforcement.

**Appeal outcomes:**
- **Upheld:** original action stands. User is notified with explanation.
- **Modified:** action is reduced (e.g., 30-day suspension reduced to 7-day). User is notified.
- **Reversed:** action is removed. User is notified with apology. Content is restored if applicable.

### Moderation Staffing

Moderation scales with user base. Community flagging and automated rules handle volume. Platform review is the bottleneck.

| User Count | Estimated Moderation Load | Staffing |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------|
| < 10,000 | ~5-15 reviews/day | Founder + 1 part-time moderator |
| 10,000-50,000 | ~20-50 reviews/day | 1-2 dedicated moderators |
| 50,000-150,000 | ~50-150 reviews/day | 3-5 moderators + lead |
| 150,000+ | ~150-500 reviews/day | Dedicated trust & safety team |

These estimates assume that community flagging and auto-moderation handle 80%+ of issues without platform review. If the ratio shifts (more false flags, more edge cases), staffing needs increase.

### Open Questions

- **Where is the line between "controversial" and "prohibited"?** A project proposing to fund a gun range is legal. A project proposing to fund a church is legal. Both may be divisive. Deluge's principle is "legal and within guidelines = allowed, community decides," but edge cases will emerge that test this principle. The moderation team needs documented guidance for edge cases, built iteratively from real situations.
- **How do you handle coordinated false flagging?** If a group of users mass-reports a legitimate project to get it hidden, the auto-hide threshold becomes a weapon. Detection of coordinated reporting (same time window, shared referral chains, new accounts) is needed. Implementation priority: Year 2.
- **Moderation transparency report?** Consider publishing quarterly moderation stats (content removed, accounts actioned, appeals outcomes) to build trust. Decision deferred until moderation volume justifies it.
