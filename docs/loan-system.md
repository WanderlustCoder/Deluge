# Microloan System

Grants fund projects. Loans fund people. Microloans let the community directly back individuals -- a person starting a bakery, buying tools for a trade, covering training costs -- with the understanding that if the borrower is responsible, the money comes back to be deployed again. If it doesn't come back, that's the risk the funder accepted.

Funders deploy capital from their watershed balance. Watersheds grow from all contribution pathways: cash contributions (100%), ad revenue (60% of each view), business card browsing revenue, referral credits, and loan repayments. Every pathway feeds the same watershed.

---

## Principles

1. **The community decides.** Deluge verifies identity and legality. Funders decide what's worth funding.
2. **Consequences are proportional, not permanent.** Credit halving, not lifetime bans. $25 floor, not $0.
3. **Once funded, funding is permanent.** No clawbacks, no vetoes, no re-funding on refinance.
4. **Funders should expect nothing.** Repayment is a hopeful outcome, not a guarantee.
5. **Flexibility through sponsorship.** The one-loan rule bends via sponsorship, with natural risk checks.
6. **Transparency over optimization.** Show the share count, the repayment progress, the risk.
7. **Support over punishment.** Refinancing prevents default. Recovery provides second chances.

## Loan Structure

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Loan amounts | $100 (Tier 1) up to $5,000 (Tier 5), based on borrower's credit progression |
| Repayment period | Set by borrower at application within tier limits: T1=6mo, T2=12mo, T3=18mo, T4-5=24mo max |
| Servicing fee | 2% of each scheduled payment, locked at origination, never changes |
| Interest rate | 0% -- there is no interest on microloans, only the servicing fee |
| Share price | $0.25 per share (fixed, universal) |
| Minimum contribution | $0.25 (one share). Fund any amount in $0.25 increments. |
| Shares per loan | Loan amount / $0.25 (e.g., $500 loan = 2,000 shares) |

---

## Loan Lifecycle

### 1. Application

**Who can apply:** Anyone with a verified Deluge account. Deluge confirms identity and legitimacy, not creditworthiness.

**Loan purpose & eligibility:** Loans are for personal growth -- any legal, reasonable purpose. The community (funders) decides what gets funded. Deluge verifies identity and legitimacy, not purpose worthiness.

Acceptable purposes (non-exhaustive): equipment for a trade or business, education/certifications/training, transportation, technology, housing-related needs, personal development.

Prohibited purposes: alcohol or drug purchases, pornography, illegal activity, gambling.

**Application fields:**
- Loan amount (within tier limit)
- Purpose category: general or niche (see Loan Discovery)
- Purpose description (specific and concrete)
- Stretch goals (optional, up to 3)
- Repayment plan: proposed monthly payment and duration (within term limits)
- Location (city/metro area)
- Personal story (optional but encouraged)

**Goal verification gate:** A borrower cannot apply for a new loan until all previous loans' goal verifications have been submitted. Special cases can be escalated through support.

### 2. Identity Verification

Same verification process as project proposers. Bank account verification for receiving disbursement and making repayments. No credit check, no income verification, no collateral.

### 3. Review and Approval

Deluge reviews for legitimacy only. Target review time: 48-72 hours. Rejection only for: unverifiable identity, fraudulent purpose, or prohibited categories.

If the loan requires sponsorship (above tier limit or concurrent), it enters a "seeking sponsors" state before proceeding to funding.

### 4. Funding

Loan appears in discovery feeds based on category and location. Funding progress visible in real-time. Funding deadline displayed prominently. Borrower can share their loan request with their network.

### 5. Resolution

At deadline (or when fully funded early), the loan resolves:

- If primary goal is met: loan proceeds. Any fully funded stretch goals are included. Unfunded stretch goal amounts return to funders' watersheds.
- If primary goal is not met: loan is cancelled. All funds return to funders' watersheds.
- Early full funding: loan closes immediately when the total requested amount (primary + all stretches) is reached, or the primary is reached for loans without stretches. No early close option when only primary is met with stretches outstanding -- borrower waits for deadline.

### 6. Borrower Acceptance

**Borrower must accept the loan before disbursement.** This applies to all loans, regardless of stretch goals. The borrower sees a Loan Agreement screen showing the final funded amount, repayment schedule, servicing fees, and credit bureau reporting terms.

- 48 hours to accept or decline. Reminder sent at 24 hours.
- If the borrower accepts: funds are disbursed. Cascade celebration.
- If the borrower declines: all funds return to funders' watersheds. No penalty.
- If no response within 72 hours: auto-cancelled. Funds return to funders' watersheds.

Funders see "Funded -- awaiting borrower confirmation" during this window and are notified of the outcome.

### 7. Disbursement

Funds disbursed to borrower's verified bank account. Repayment schedule set based on actual funded amount. First payment due 30 days after disbursement.

### 8. Repayment

See Payment Mechanics below.

### 9. Completion

All payments made. Loan marked complete. Borrower submits goal verification. Credit progression advances.

---

## One Loan at a Time

A user may have one active loan at a time. Must repay (or default and recover) before taking a new one.

**Exceptions via sponsorship:**
- **Sponsor-upward:** Sponsors vouch to increase an existing loan. Full sponsorship power. Payment schedule adjusts.
- **Concurrent loan:** Sponsors enable a second loan for a different purpose. Halved sponsorship power. Both loans follow standard rules independently. Hard cap: 2 active loans maximum.

---

## Funding Deadlines & Stretch Goals

### Deadlines

Every loan has a funding deadline. Deadlines scale with tier:

| Tier | Max Amount | Base Deadline |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Tier 1 | $100 | 7 days |
| Tier 2 | $500 | 14 days |
| Tier 3 | $1,000 | 21 days |
| Tier 4 | $2,000 | 30 days |
| Tier 5 | $5,000 | 45 days |

### Sponsor Extensions

Established sponsors can extend deadlines. Maximum 2 extensions per loan, each by a different sponsor.

- First extension: +1x original deadline
- Second extension: +0.5x original deadline

| Tier | Base | 1st Extension (+1x) | 2nd Extension (+0.5x) | Max Total |
|------|------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Tier 1 ($100) | 7 days | +7 = 14 | +3 = 17 | 17 days |
| Tier 2 ($500) | 14 days | +14 = 28 | +7 = 35 | 35 days |
| Tier 3 ($1,000) | 21 days | +21 = 42 | +10 = 52 | 52 days |
| Tier 4 ($2,000) | 30 days | +30 = 60 | +15 = 75 | 75 days |
| Tier 5 ($5,000) | 45 days | +45 = 90 | +22 = 112 | 112 days |

### Stretch Goals

Up to 3 prioritized additions beyond the primary goal. Each has a specific amount and purpose. Funding fills primary first, then stretches in priority order. Each stretch is all-or-nothing.

Example: $800 total for a bakery (Primary: $500 oven, Stretch 1: $200 signage, Stretch 2: $100 inventory).

| Raised | Primary ($500) | Stretch 1 ($200) | Stretch 2 ($100) | Loan Funds At | Returned |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| $400 | Not met | -- | -- | Cancelled | $400 |
| $500 | Funded | -- | -- | $500 | $0 |
| $600 | Funded | Not met ($100 short) | -- | $500 | $100 |
| $700 | Funded | Funded | -- | $700 | $0 |
| $750 | Funded | Funded | Not met | $700 | $50 |
| $800 | Funded | Funded | Funded | $800 | $0 |

The share model handles partial funding naturally: trailing funders (last to contribute) get contributions returned. First-in stays, last-in gets refunded.

After resolution, the borrower accepts or declines the full resolved amount. No option to accept a partial amount.

---

## Discovery: General, Niche, and Regional

Not all loan purposes appeal to all funders. The discovery system surfaces the right loans to the right funders without hiding anything -- every loan is always findable through search and direct links.

**Discovery hierarchy:** Location first, then category.

**General loans (surface in everyone's feed):**
- Transportation, Education, Business/Trade, Credit Building, Medical/Health, Faith/Community

**Niche loans (surface via community group membership):**
- Housing/Renter Assistance, Technology/Gaming, Recreation/Hobbies, Lifestyle/Personal, Pets

Community groups are the opt-in mechanism. Joining a group subscribes you to that niche's loans.

**Regional layering:**
- Local (same city/metro) -- shown first
- Regional (same state) -- secondary
- National -- no boost, fully accessible

**Feed composition:** Local general > local niche (opted-in) > regional general > regional niche > national general > national niche.

**Categorization:** Borrower self-categorizes. Funders can flag miscategorization. Loans can have multiple tags. Miscategorization is corrected, not punished. General/niche lists evolve based on funding patterns.

**Prohibited categories always enforced:** Alcohol, drugs, pornography, illegal activity, gambling. No community group can override.

---

## Funder Experience

### Funding a Loan

1. Funder taps a loan card, views borrower profile and purpose
2. Loan detail page shows: borrower info, verified identity status, purpose and category, location, total amount with stretch goals, funding deadline, payment schedule, share price ($0.25), total shares in loan, shares remaining, your share count
3. Funder taps "Fund this loan"
4. $0.25 minimum (one share). Fund any amount in $0.25 increments. Watershed funds can come from cash contributions, ad revenue, business card browsing revenue, referral credits, or recycled loan repayments -- multiple pathways to build a watershed balance without cash on hand.
5. Funds come from watershed balance
6. **Risk disclosure (mandatory, not skippable):** "This is a loan, not a grant. If the borrower repays, your contribution will return to your watershed a little at a time. If the borrower does not repay, some or all of your contribution may be lost. Deluge does not guarantee repayment."
7. Confirmation shows share count and estimated repayment timeline: "You funded 80 shares ($20.00). Estimated full repayment by month 8."

### During the Acceptance Window

Funders see "Funded -- awaiting borrower confirmation." If the borrower accepts, funders are notified and the cascade fires. If the borrower declines or times out, funders are notified and funds return to watersheds.

### Tracking a Funded Loan

From the My Impact tab: borrower name and purpose, repayment progress (shares repaid out of total, e.g., "42 of 80 shares repaid -- $10.50 of $20.00"), borrower updates, loan status (On time / Late / Defaulted).

### Loan Q&A

Loan pages have a lightweight Q&A section:
- 2 questions per funder per loan, 280 character limit
- Borrower optionally responds. One question, one answer -- no threaded replies.
- Community can flag inappropriate questions. Auto-hidden at 3+ flags.

### When Funds Return

Your money comes back a little at a time. Each payment cycle, funders receive repayment on a portion of their shares. Smaller contributions finish first (fewer shares to repay), larger contributions stay in the loan longer. Watershed replenishment notification on each repayment. Final repayment triggers a completion animation.

---

## Payment Mechanics

### Repayment Term Limits

| Tier | Max Loan | Max Repayment Term |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| Tier 1 | $100 | 6 months |
| Tier 2 | $500 | 12 months |
| Tier 3 | $1,000 | 18 months |
| Tier 4 | $2,000 | 24 months |
| Tier 5 | $5,000 | 24 months |

Term limits apply at origination. Refinancing can exceed these limits (see Refinancing).

Funders see the full repayment timeline and estimated share repayment schedule when funding. Funders should treat contributions as gifts with hopeful repayment.

### Standard Payment

Borrower pays scheduled amount + 2% fee. Example: $60 principal + $1.20 fee = $61.20. Principal repays the next batch of shares in interleaved FIFO order, distributing small amounts across all active funders proportionally. Fee goes to Deluge.

### Overpayment

Overpayment above the scheduled principal is fee-free. The overpayment repays additional shares in interleaved queue order. Credit-forward applies only to sub-$0.25 remainders that don't fill a complete share.

### Double Payment

When a borrower makes a second payment in the same period, they choose:
- **Pay next month early** -- counts as a scheduled payment, fee applies, advances the due date
- **Pay down principal** -- fee-free, enters credit-forward, loan gets shorter

### Credit-Forward

Credit-forward holds sub-$0.25 remainders when a payment doesn't divide evenly into shares. This is a near-trivial edge case under the share model since most payments divide cleanly into $0.25 shares.

- Sits in credit-forward, fee-free
- Combines with the next payment to fill additional shares
- Visible to borrower: "Credit toward next share: $0.15"
- Resolves fully at loan completion

### Servicing Fee Revenue

| Loan Size | Payment | Fee/Payment (2%) | Total Payments | Total Fee Revenue |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| $100 | $25 | $0.50 | 4 | $2.00 |
| $200 | $40 | $0.80 | 5 | $4.00 |
| $500 | $60 | $1.20 | ~9 | ~$10.80 |
| $1,000 | $100 | $2.00 | 10 | $20.00 |
| $2,000 | $150 | $3.00 | ~14 | ~$42.00 |
| $5,000 | $250 | $5.00 | 20 | $100.00 |

This is not a primary revenue stream. The value of microloans is mission alignment and user engagement, not platform revenue.

### Share-Based Interleaved FIFO Disbursement Model

Every contribution is broken into $0.25 shares. Shares are interleaved round-robin across the repayment queue, with each funder's position within each round determined by their funding time (earliest funder first). The core rule: **no funder receives share N+1 until all active funders have received share N.** This ensures proportional repayment -- at any point during the loan, all funders have been repaid roughly the same percentage of their contribution.

Each payment repays the next batch of shares in queue order. Smaller funders finish first (fewer shares, exit rotation sooner). Larger funders stay in the loan longer (more shares, deeper into the queue). Default risk is proportional -- all funders are at roughly the same percentage repaid at any point.

**Example: $500 loan, $60 monthly payment, 3 funders (among others):**

- Funder A (day 1): $50 = 200 shares
- Funder B (day 2): $20 = 80 shares
- Funder C (day 3): $5 = 20 shares
- Other funders: $425 = 1,700 shares
- Total: 2,000 shares

Round-robin interleave order: A, B, C, [others...], A, B, C, [others...], ...

Each $60 payment repays 240 shares. With all funders in rotation, each funder receives repayment proportional to their share of the loan per cycle.

| Payment # | Shares Repaid | A receives | B receives | C receives | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | 240 | ~$6.00 (24 shares) | ~$2.50 (10 shares) | ~$0.50 (2 shares) | All funders active |
| 2 | 240 | ~$6.00 | ~$2.50 | ~$0.50 | C nearing completion |
| ~3 | 240 | ~$6.00 | ~$2.50 | -- | C fully repaid, exits rotation |
| ~4 | 240 | ~$6.25 | ~$2.50 | -- | B nearing completion |
| ~5 | 240 | ~$6.50 | -- | -- | B fully repaid, exits rotation |
| ... | 240 | ~$6.75+ | -- | -- | A stays through end of loan |

C (20 shares) finishes first. B (80 shares) finishes next. A (200 shares) stays through the end as the last funder group standing. At any point before completion, all active funders have been repaid roughly the same fraction of their contribution.

---

## Credit Progression

Loan repayment history builds toward eligibility for larger future loans.

| Tier | Max Loan Amount | Requirement |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Tier 1 | $100 | Verified Deluge account |
| Tier 2 | $500 | 1 loan repaid in full, on time |
| Tier 3 | $1,000 | 2 loans repaid in full, no more than 1 late payment total |
| Tier 4 | $2,000 | 3+ loans repaid in full, strong repayment history |
| Tier 5 | $5,000 | Established track record, community standing |

**What affects progression:**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| On-time payments | Positive -- builds toward next tier |
| Early repayment | Positive -- accelerates tier progression |
| Late payments | Negative -- delays progression (does not reduce current tier) |
| Default | Credit halved after recovery. Borrower rebuilds from reduced amount. |

**What does NOT affect progression:** Dollar amount of loans, number of funders, time on platform.

### Credit Bureau Reporting

Deluge reports repayment history to major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax). On-time payments build real credit scores. This transforms microloans into a financial stepping stone -- "I built my credit score through Deluge."

Implementation roadmap: Research & legal (Year 2), partnership (Year 2-3), integration (Year 3), launch (Year 3-4). Total estimated cost: $75-120K.

### Voluntary Credit Score Sharing

Borrowers can optionally report credit score point increases (not actual scores). "My credit went up +22 points!" Displayed on loan detail pages and aggregated at community level. No verification -- trust-based sharing. Triggers the "Credit Builder" badge for funders.

### Credit Rehabilitation After Default

When a loan exits default via recovery, the borrower's available credit is halved.

**Rules:**
- Halved from current credit limit at time of default
- Rounded down to nearest $5
- Absolute minimum: $25
- Borrower rebuilds from halved credit using normal progression rules

| Credit Before Default | After Recovery (Halved) | Notes |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| $1,000 | $500 | Clean halving |
| $500 | $250 | Clean halving |
| $100 (Tier 1) | $50 | Clean halving |
| $50 | $25 | $25 is the minimum floor |
| $25 | $25 | Already at minimum |

---

## Goal Verification

When the borrower fulfills the loan's objective, they provide a single update showing the goal was met. Trust-and-verify with community oversight -- not a strict audit.

**How it works:**
- One verification update when the loan's stated purpose has been fulfilled
- Acceptable forms: photos, receipts, written update, or combination
- Community can view evidence and flag concerns
- Deluge reviews flagged cases but does not proactively audit every loan
- Triggers the "Pulse Check" badge for funders

**Verification depth scales with loan size:**

| Tier | Expectation |
|------|-------------|
| Tier 1 ($100) | Light touch -- brief written update or single photo |
| Tier 2 ($500) | Photo or receipt showing the purchase/goal |
| Tier 3 ($1,000) | Photo(s) plus receipt or brief written explanation |
| Tier 4 ($2,000) | Receipts and photos documenting the outcome |
| Tier 5 ($5,000) | Comprehensive: receipts, photos, and written summary |

**Consequence of failed verification:** Loan block (not account ban). Borrower retains all other platform features.

**Goal verification gates future loans:** Borrower cannot apply for new loans until all previous loans' goal verifications have been submitted. Submission, not approval, is the requirement. Special cases through support.

---

## Sponsorship

Sponsors extend a borrower's credit ceiling. They don't fund the loan -- funders bear the financial risk. Sponsors bear reputational risk.

### How Sponsorship Power Works

```
sponsorship_power = base_contributions x multiplier
```

- `base_contributions` = total platform contributions (cash contributed + ad-funded)
- `multiplier` = track_record_ratio x (100% + volume_bonus), capped at 200%
- `track_record_ratio` = total_repaid_value / total_completed_value
- `volume_bonus` = grows with successful sponsorship history, up to +100%

| Sponsor Profile | Base | Track Record | Volume Bonus | Multiplier | Power |
|----------------|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| New sponsor | $2,000 | 100% (no history) | 0% | 100% | $2,000 |
| Active sponsor | $3,000 | 100% ($5K repaid) | +50% | 150% | $4,500 |
| Veteran sponsor | $5,000 | 98% ($20K repaid) | +100% | 198% | $9,900 |
| Sponsor with defaults | $3,000 | 75% ($1.5K of $2K) | +20% | 90% | $2,700 |

### Default Recovery for Sponsors (2-for-1 Counteraction)

When a sponsored loan defaults, the sponsor recovers by sponsoring new loans totaling 2x the defaulted amount (any combination of sizes).

### Sponsor-Upward

Increase an existing active loan. Full sponsorship power. Payment schedule adjusts. Additional funders' shares are added to the rotation.

### Concurrent Loan Sponsorship

Enable a second loan for a different purpose. Sponsorship power halved. Both loans independent. Hard cap: 2 active loans.

**Default independence:** Default on one loan does not affect the concurrent loan. Once funded, funding is permanent.

**Concurrent loan economics:**

| Sponsor Profile | Full Power | Power for Concurrent | Effect |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| New ($500 power) | $500 | $250 | Less coverage |
| Established ($1,300) | $1,300 | $650 | Requires more sponsors |
| Veteran ($3,600) | $3,600 | $1,800 | Still substantial |

### Retroactive Recovery

When a sponsored loan exits default through recovery:
- Default reclassified as "recovered" -- no longer counts against track record
- Counteraction credit refunded if already spent
- Sponsorship power recalculates

### Sponsor Visibility

Funders evaluating a sponsored loan see: number of sponsors, combined credit extension, each sponsor's track record, and whether the borrower earned their tier naturally or through sponsorship.

---

## Default Handling

### Escalation Timeline

**Late (1-30 days overdue):**
- Gentle reminders. Status: "Late." No additional fees.

**At risk (31-90 days overdue):**
- Prominent notifications. Status: "At risk." Deluge may reach out directly.

**Default (90+ days overdue, no communication):**
- Status: "Defaulted"
- Credit halved if and when borrower recovers
- All funders with unrepaid shares should expect to lose the remaining portion of their contribution
- Funder notification: "Your remaining shares are unlikely to be repaid."
- Sponsors' track records updated proportionally
- Default reported to credit bureaus
- Borrower is not banned -- recovery path exists

**Partial repayment before default:** Because shares are interleaved round-robin, all funders have been repaid roughly the same percentage of their contribution at the point of default. Smaller funders may have already finished (exited rotation), but all active funders share the loss proportionally. There is no positional advantage -- risk is distributed equally. This is disclosed at time of funding.

### Default Recovery

**Path 1: Three consecutive on-time payments** at the scheduled amount (or refinanced amount). Loan status: "recovering" during this period, then "active."

**Path 2: Full payoff** of remaining balance. Immediate exit from default.

**On exit from default:**
- Credit halved (see Credit Rehabilitation)
- Sponsors' track records retroactively restored
- Remaining funders with unrepaid shares resume receiving disbursements
- Credit bureau reporting updated

**What recovery does NOT do:**
- Erase the default from loan history
- Restore full credit limit
- Retroactively repay shares that were written off during the default period

---

## Refinancing

A support tool to help borrowers avoid or recover from default. Not a revenue mechanism.

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Minimum loan balance | $1,000. Below this, the 3-payment recovery path or full payoff is the right tool. |
| Fee | 1% of remaining balance, or $10 minimum, whichever is greater |
| When available | Any time during active loan, or during default to enable recovery |
| Effect on share queue | No change -- funders keep their shares and rotation positions |
| Effect on term limits | Can exceed the tier's original term cap. Term limits apply at origination, not post-refinance. |

Refinancing can exceed tier term limits because it is a recovery tool, not a new origination. The alternative is default, which is worse for everyone. Once funded, funding is permanent -- the community doesn't get a veto on refinanced terms.

**What refinancing changes:** Scheduled payment amount, number of remaining payments, servicing fee per payment.

**What refinancing does NOT change:** Total remaining principal, share rotation order, loan history.

---

## Economics

### Default Rates

| Scenario | Default Rate | Impact on Funders |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Optimistic | 5% | 1 in 20 loans loses funder capital |
| Base | 10% | 1 in 10 loans loses funder capital |
| Conservative | 15% | ~1 in 7 loans loses funder capital |

At 10% default with $500 average loans, a funder backing 10 loans ($200 total) loses ~$20 to defaults and recovers ~$180. The recovered $180 can be redeployed -- one cycle of $200 does ~$380 in total lending over two cycles.

### Default Recovery Economics (30% recovery rate among defaults)

| Year | Defaults | Recovered | Capital Eventually Returned | Net Lost |
|------|----------|-----------|---------------------------|----------|
| 3 | $8,000 | $2,400 | ~$2,000 | ~$6,000 |
| 4 | $25,000 | $7,500 | ~$6,000 | ~$19,000 |
| 5 | $60,000 | $18,000 | ~$15,000 | ~$45,000 |

A 30% recovery rate among defaults improves the effective default rate from 10% to ~7%.

### Recycled Capital Projections (base scenario)

| Year | Active Loans | Avg Loan Size | Total Deployed | Repaid & Recycled | Cumulative Impact |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2 | 50 | $300 | $15,000 | $10,000 | $25,000 |
| 3 | 200 | $400 | $80,000 | $55,000 | $135,000 |
| 4 | 500 | $500 | $250,000 | $180,000 | $430,000 |
| 5 | 1,000 | $600 | $600,000 | $450,000 | $1,050,000 |

Cumulative Impact counts every dollar deployed, including recycled capital. One dollar through two cycles counts as $2 of impact. Grants deploy once; loans deploy repeatedly.

### Risk by Sponsorship Type

| Loan Type | Estimated Default Rate |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Tier-earned (organic) | ~10% |
| Sponsored (standard/upward) | 15-20% |
| Concurrent (sponsored) | 20-25% |

Platform should monitor these separately and adjust if gaps widen.
