# Business Model

## Core Model: Community-Driven Giving

Deluge is a platform where communities fund what matters. Users contribute cash or attention (watching ads, browsing local businesses, volunteering, referring friends), and those contributions flow to community-proposed projects. There is no investment component, no portfolio management, no brokerage. The platform does one thing: it makes community giving transparent, collective, and sustainable.

### Who Deluge Serves

The target user is the person who donates to every GoFundMe in their feed, volunteers for neighborhood cleanups, and shares every fundraiser they see. The person who wants to help but doesn't know where their money goes after they give it. Deluge doesn't compete with investment platforms -- it competes with the fragmented, opaque world of informal community giving.

### How It Works

1. **Users contribute** -- cash ($1 minimum), or attention (ads, business cards, volunteering, referrals)
2. **Contributions flow to the watershed** -- each user's personal impact fund
3. **Users deploy from their watershed** -- to community projects (one-way grants) or microloans (recycling capital)
4. **Projects cascade** -- when fully funded, the project is executed, verified, and reported
5. **Microloans recycle** -- repayments return to the watershed, enabling the same dollar to fund multiple projects over time

### Why This Model Works

Individual giving is diffuse and invisible. $10 to a GoFundMe disappears into a total and the giver never knows what happened. Deluge concentrates small contributions from many people into visible, verifiable outcomes. One person watching 3 ads a day contributes $0.027 to a project. 10,000 people doing the same thing contribute $97,200/year -- from attention alone.

This is the raindrop-to-river thesis: individual contributions are small, but collective and persistent giving creates measurable community impact. The platform's job is to make the collective visible and to make giving easy enough that people do it daily, not just when a GoFundMe shows up in their feed.

### What Deluge Does Not Do

- **No investment accounts.** Deluge does not manage, invest, or custody user funds for wealth-building purposes.
- **No securities.** Deluge is not a broker-dealer, investment advisor, or securities platform.
- **No portfolio management.** There are no stocks, bonds, ETFs, or investment products.
- **No enforced savings mechanisms.** If users want to invest in their own financial future, Deluge encourages it through education and messaging -- but doesn't build the infrastructure.

This simplification is deliberate. The giving side -- communities, projects, cascades, community grants, microloans, the watershed -- is what makes Deluge different. Investment infrastructure is commodity that any funded startup can replicate. Removing it lets the team focus entirely on what makes the platform unique: making community giving work.

## Fee Structure: Tiered Subscriptions + Ad Revenue

No per-transaction fees. Revenue comes from subscriptions, ad revenue, and corporate partnerships.

### Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0/month | Watch ads to fund projects, browse business cards, basic community features, $1 minimum cash contribution |
| **Deluge Basic** | $3/month | 1.5x ad impact multiplier, basic impact analytics, project following, notification preferences, ad-free browsing option |
| **Deluge Plus** | $5/month | 2x ad impact multiplier, advanced impact analytics, priority project access, community creation tools, enhanced project discovery |
| **Deluge Premium** | $12/month | Everything in Plus, 3x ad impact multiplier, family accounts (up to 4), tax documentation tools, white-glove support, early access to features |
| **Deluge Impact** | $25/month | Everything in Premium, $10/month Deluge-funded watershed credit, enhanced impact reporting and certification, named recognition on funded projects |

**Ad impact multiplier explained:** Paid subscribers' ad views generate more impact for projects. When a Basic subscriber watches an ad, their chosen project receives 1.5x the base contribution instead of 1x. The extra comes from a portion of the subscription revenue -- your subscription directly amplifies your attention-funded giving.

**Multiplier economics (per ad view, base eCPM):**

| Tier | Per-Ad to Project | Extra Funded by Subscription | Monthly Cost at 5 ads/day |
|------|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Free | $0.009 | -- | -- |
| Basic (1.5x) | $0.0135 | $0.0045 | $0.68 of $3.00 subscription |
| Plus (2x) | $0.018 | $0.009 | $1.35 of $5.00 subscription |
| Premium (3x) | $0.027 | $0.018 | $2.70 of $12.00 subscription |
| Impact (3x) | $0.027 | $0.018 | $2.70 of $25.00 subscription |

Multiplier costs are easily covered by subscription revenue, even at maximum daily ad consumption (10 ads/day: Basic costs $1.35 of $3.00; Premium costs $5.40 of $12.00).

### Ad-Funded Impact

Users can watch video ads to fund community projects directly. Ad revenue goes straight to the projects they choose. This gives every user a way to contribute to their community, even with $0 in cash.

**"Can't give money? Donate your attention instead."**

**How it works:**
1. User watches a 30-second video ad
2. Advertiser pays Deluge (platform earns ad revenue)
3. Deluge keeps 40% for platform operations
4. Remaining 60% goes directly to the user's chosen impact project

**Economics per ad view (conservative):**

| Metric | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Advertiser pays Deluge (eCPM) | $8 CPM ($0.008/view) | $15 CPM ($0.015/view) | $25 CPM ($0.025/view) |
| Deluge keeps (platform margin) | 40% ($0.0032) | 40% ($0.006) | 40% ($0.01) |
| Credited to project | 60% ($0.0048) | 60% ($0.009) | 60% ($0.015) |

**Transparency note:** Deluge must clearly disclose how the ad revenue is split. "$0.009 from this ad went to [Project Name]. Deluge kept $0.006 to run the platform." This is the opposite of exploitative models that obscure their economics.

**Caps and controls:**

| Control | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Daily cap | 10 ads per user per day |
| Monthly max to projects (base) | ~$2.70/month (10 ads/day x 30 days x $0.009) |
| Streak bonuses (future) | 7-day streak = 1.25x, 30-day = 1.5x |
| Paid tier multiplier | Basic subscribers get 1.5x ad impact ($0.0135/view to projects) |
| Anti-fraud | CAPTCHA, pattern detection, device fingerprinting, account verification |

**What this means for projects (per user):**

| Usage Pattern | Monthly to Projects | Annual to Projects |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Casual (2 ads/day) | $0.54 | $6.48 |
| Regular (5 ads/day) | $1.35 | $16.20 |
| Max (10 ads/day) | $2.70 | $32.40 |

**What this means collectively (the real story):**

| Users Watching Ads | Avg Views/Day | Monthly to Projects | Annual to Projects |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1,000 | 3 | $810 | $9,720 |
| 10,000 | 3 | $8,100 | $97,200 |
| 50,000 | 3 | $40,500 | $486,000 |

These are small numbers per person. The value is in the collective: 10,000 users watching 3 ads a day funds nearly $100K in projects annually -- from attention alone, no cash required. This is the raindrop-to-river effect applied to advertising revenue.

**What this means for Deluge (platform revenue from ads):**

| Users Watching Ads | Avg Views/Day | Daily Ad Revenue (Deluge's 40%) | Annual |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| 1,000 | 3 | $18 | $6,570 |
| 10,000 | 3 | $180 | $65,700 |
| 50,000 | 3 | $900 | $328,500 |

Ad revenue is a meaningful supplement, not a primary revenue driver. Don't build the business model around it.

**Why ad revenue goes directly to projects:** The per-ad amount ($0.009 at base) is too small to be meaningful in isolation. But pooled across thousands of users and concentrated into specific projects, ad revenue becomes a real funding source. This aligns with the platform's core thesis: individual drops become collective force. Ad revenue flows directly to user-chosen projects rather than through the watershed, keeping the attention-to-impact pathway simple and immediate.

### Local Business Directory (Community Business Cards)

Alongside video ads, Deluge offers a local business directory where browsing funds community projects. Small businesses create simple digital "business cards" -- name, services, location, photo, short description -- instead of producing video ads. Users browse cards like a local business directory, and each view generates a small contribution to projects.

**"Discover local businesses. Every view funds your community."**

**Why this exists alongside video ads:**

Video ads require production budgets that local businesses don't have. A neighborhood coffee shop, a local plumber, a community bookstore -- they can create a card in 10 minutes on their phone but can't produce a 30-second video ad. The business card format removes the production barrier entirely while creating a new surface for community funding.

**How it works:**

1. Local business creates a listing: business name, category, location, one photo, 50-word description
2. Users browse business cards by category or proximity (within the Give tab or a dedicated Local section)
3. Each view generates a small contribution to the user's chosen project
4. Users can save businesses they're interested in, leave recommendations
5. Businesses see a dashboard: views, saves, and community impact generated by their listing

**Economics per view:**

| Metric | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Revenue per card view | $0.001 | $0.002 | $0.003 |
| Deluge keeps (40%) | $0.0004 | $0.0008 | $0.0012 |
| Credited to project (60%) | $0.0006 | $0.0012 | $0.0018 |

Per-view value is significantly lower than video ads, but volume is much higher. A user can flip through 50 cards in a minute versus watching one 30-second video.

**Per-user impact from card browsing:**

| Usage Pattern | Views/Day | Monthly to Projects (base) |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Casual (10 cards/day) | 10 | $0.36 |
| Regular (30 cards/day) | 30 | $1.08 |
| Active (50 cards/day) | 50 | $1.80 |

Combined with video ads (5/day = $1.35/month), an active browser generates $3.15/month to projects from attention alone.

**What this means collectively:**

| Active Browsers | Avg Views/Day | Monthly to Projects | Annual to Projects |
|----------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1,000 | 20 | $720 | $8,640 |
| 10,000 | 20 | $7,200 | $86,400 |
| 50,000 | 20 | $36,000 | $432,000 |

**Business model for listings:**

| Model | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Free listings | Basic listing is free -- removes all barriers for small businesses |
| Premium listings (future) | Enhanced visibility, featured placement, analytics -- small monthly fee ($5-15/month) |
| Sponsored projects | Businesses can link their listing to a specific project: "Views of our listing fund Lincoln Elementary's garden" |

**Value to the business:**

- Exposure to a self-selected audience of community-minded people (exactly who local businesses want to reach)
- Community impact badge: "Supporting local projects through Deluge" for their storefront window
- Dashboard showing their listing's contribution: "Your listing has contributed $47 to local projects this month"
- Association with community values without a large ad budget

**Why users browse instead of using Yelp:**

Browsing on Yelp benefits Yelp. Browsing on Deluge funds your neighborhood. For the target user -- the community-oriented person who wants to support local -- that's a meaningful difference. The directory also filters for values-aligned businesses: a business that lists on Deluge is signaling community commitment.

**Content quality:**

Local business cards don't require production quality. A photo of the storefront, a brief description of services, and location information is sufficient. The format is closer to a community bulletin board than a glossy ad platform. This is deliberate -- it matches the community-driven, authentic tone of the platform.

**Geographic scaling:**

Local business cards require enough users and businesses in a geography to be useful. This is a market-by-market feature:
- Launch in initial markets where Deluge has user density
- Expand to new markets as user base grows
- In markets without local business listings, the Give tab focuses on video ads and community grants

## Free-Tier Participation Pathways

Ad-funded impact gives every user a way to contribute, but at $2.70/month (10 ads/day, base scenario), it takes over 7 months for a free-tier user to accumulate enough watershed capital to fund a single microloan contribution. That's too slow. A user who can't contribute cash needs a realistic on-ramp to meaningful participation within their first month or two.

Three additional mechanisms address this: referral credits, community grants (sweat equity), and corporate ad matching. Each uses a different funding source and serves a different role in the free-tier experience.

### Referral Credits

Users earn watershed capital when they refer new users who become active on the platform. Every successful referral saves $10-20 versus paid advertising, so funding referral credits from the marketing budget is ROI-positive.

**Vesting model:**

Credits vest in stages tied to the referred user's real engagement, not just signup. This protects against fake accounts, self-referral, and collusion rings.

| Milestone | Credit to Referrer | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Friend signs up + verifies identity | $0.50 | Baseline -- real person confirmed |
| Friend completes first action (first cash contribution or first 5 ads watched) | $1.00 | Genuine engagement, not a throwaway |
| Friend is active at Day 30 (logged in 5+ times, any activity) | $1.00 | Retained user -- the referral stuck |
| **Total per referral (ad-only referred user)** | **$2.50** | |

If the referred user makes a cash contribution of $5 or more, the "first action" milestone pays $1.50 instead of $1.00, bringing the total to $3.00 per referral.

**Rate limits:**

| Control | Limit | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Monthly referral cap | 10 referrals | Prevents industrial-scale farming |
| Lifetime referral cap | 50 referrals | Diminishing returns; 50 referrals is enormous growth contribution |
| Credit destination | Watershed only | No cash extraction -- credits fund projects or loans only |
| Referral link expiry | 7 days of inactivity | Referred user must take a meaningful action within 7 days |

**Anti-fraud requirements for the referred user:**

- Unique phone number (SMS verification)
- Unique device (fingerprint)
- Cannot share a bank account with the referrer
- Activity thresholds must be met organically (no automated ad-watching, no instant-abandon patterns)

**Fraud vectors and mitigations:**

| Attack | How It Works | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Self-referral | User creates multiple accounts, refers themselves | Device fingerprinting, phone number uniqueness, bank account uniqueness |
| Account farming | Creates 50 fake accounts to refer to one real account | Activity thresholds before credit releases -- real engagement required |
| Collusion rings | Groups sign up for each other, extract credits, go dormant | Credit doesn't fully vest until Day 30 with real activity |
| Bought referrals | Pays strangers to sign up using their link | Activity thresholds filter out mercenary signups who never engage |

**Economics:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cost per referral to Deluge | $2.50-3.00 (watershed credit) |
| Cost per paid acquisition (current) | $15-25 |
| Net savings per referral vs. paid | $12-22 |
| Monthly budget at 1,000 referrals/month | $2,500-3,000 |

Referral credits are front-loaded and exhaustible -- a user's referral network saturates after a few months. Expected per-user referral earnings: $5-15 in the first 2-3 months, tapering to near-zero after 6 months. This is an onboarding boost, not a long-term earning mechanism.

**Funding source:** Marketing budget. Referral credits directly offset paid acquisition costs.

---

### Community Grants (Sweat Equity)

Community members can propose real-world projects that need hands-on volunteer labor. The community funds materials and volunteer compensation through the standard project funding mechanism. Volunteers earn watershed credit for verified completed work. This creates a direct pathway for any user -- particularly free-tier users -- to earn meaningful watershed capital through community service.

Deluge does not oversee the work. This operates like any other grant: Deluge verifies legitimacy, facilitates funding, and stays out of execution. The community handles everything else.

**How it works:**

1. **Anyone proposes a community grant project**
   - Description of work needed, with specific requirements
   - Before photos/evidence of current state
   - Materials budget (if any)
   - Volunteer watershed credit amount (set by the poster)
   - Number of volunteer slots (one or more)
   - If multi-volunteer: discrete tasks or areas defined per slot, credit split evenly
   - Project timeline (default: 60 days; poster can set a custom timeline)
   - Beneficiary designation (see below)

2. **Contributors fund it**
   - Funds are escrowed, not released
   - Funding goal includes both materials AND volunteer watershed credit
   - Contributors see the full breakdown: "$50 for materials + $15 volunteer watershed credit = $65 total"
   - Minimum 3 contributors to proceed (seeds the approver pool)

3. **Volunteers pick up the work**
   - Volunteers browse available funded projects and agree to posted requirements and pay
   - Take it or leave it -- no negotiation
   - Volunteer does not have to be a free-tier user; anyone can volunteer

4. **Work is completed, evidence submitted**
   - After photos/video evidence posted by volunteer
   - GPS-tagged, timestamped photos required (location must match before photos)
   - Progress updates encouraged during the work

5. **Randomized contributor approval**
   - Approvers randomly selected from the contributor pool
   - Minimum 3, maximum 7 approvers depending on contributor count
   - If 3 or fewer contributors, all serve as approvers
   - Simple vote: "Work completed as described" / "Work not completed" / "Can't determine"
   - Majority approval releases escrowed funds and credits the volunteer's watershed
   - If approval is split with no majority, Deluge reviews manually

6. **Payout**
   - Material funds released for procurement/reimbursement
   - Volunteer receives watershed credit as posted
   - For multi-volunteer projects: each slot is independently verified and independently paid

**Beneficiary designation:**

Two project subtypes based on who benefits:

| Subtype | Beneficiary | Example | Requirements |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Individual beneficiary | A specific named person | Mrs. Johnson's yard cleanup | Named beneficiary required. Beneficiary consent required (video, signed note, or in-app confirmation). Privacy option available -- "A neighbor in Denver" is sufficient for the public listing. |
| Community benefit | The community at large | Roadside trash cleanup, park maintenance, public garden | No individual beneficiary. Contributors implicitly benefit as community members. Any contributor can mark themselves as a beneficiary endorser. GPS-tagged photos must show a public/community space. |

**If the proposer is also the volunteer:** A named individual beneficiary (who is not the proposer/volunteer) is required, OR the project must be clearly community-benefit (public space, verifiable from GPS-tagged evidence of a public/community location).

**Quality expectations (explicit in UX):**

Community grant volunteers are offering good-faith effort, not professional services. This must be clearly communicated to both sides:

- **To the poster:** "Community volunteers are donating their time and effort, not professional services. If your project requires licensed, insured, or professional-grade work, consider hiring a professional through the platform instead."
- **To the volunteer:** "This is volunteer community work. You're agreeing to put in good-faith effort toward the posted requirements."
- **To the approvers:** "Was the described work completed in good faith? This is a yes/no question about effort and completion, not a quality review."

If professional-grade work is needed, the poster can create a standard project grant with a professional labor budget instead. Same funding infrastructure, different execution expectations and pay scale.

**Multi-volunteer projects:**

- Poster defines discrete tasks or areas per volunteer slot when creating the project
- Each slot has a defined scope (e.g., "Slot 1: clear north side. Slot 2: clear south side. Slot 3: bag and haul debris")
- Watershed credit is split evenly across slots
- Each slot is independently verified and independently paid
- If a volunteer abandons their slot: slot reopens for a replacement volunteer. If no replacement is found by the project timeline, that slot's credit returns to contributors

**Volunteer abandonment:**

If a volunteer agrees to a project and does not submit completion evidence by the project timeline, the escrow returns to contributors for that volunteer's portion. No penalty to the volunteer beyond not earning the credit.

**Project timeline:**

- Default: 60 days from when the project is fully funded and a volunteer has been assigned
- Poster can set a custom timeline at project creation
- If the project is funded but no volunteer picks it up within the timeline, contributors are notified and funds return to their watersheds
- The project can be reposted

**Anti-fraud protections:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Fake before/after photos | GPS-tagged, timestamped photos required. Location must match between before and after. |
| Proposer-volunteer collusion | If proposer is also volunteer, individual beneficiary (third party) or community-benefit designation required. |
| Contributor-volunteer collusion | Approvers randomly selected from contributor pool. Approvers cannot share a referral chain with the volunteer. |
| Inflated project scope or pay | Contributors decide whether to fund. The crowd self-corrects -- nobody funds "$100 for picking up 3 pieces of trash." |

**Funding source:** The community. Volunteer watershed credit is included in the project funding goal alongside materials. Contributors explicitly fund the volunteer credit. Deluge does not subsidize. Money flows: contributors → escrow → (materials + volunteer watershed credit). Deluge facilitates, does not fund.

**Economics:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Platform cost per project | $0 (community-funded) |
| Average project funding goal (est.) | $30-80 (materials + volunteer credit) |
| Average volunteer credit per project (est.) | $10-20 |
| Verification overhead | Minimal (randomized contributor approval, automated) |

Community grants are the lowest-cost free-tier pathway for Deluge because the platform doesn't fund them. The community does. Deluge's cost is limited to the project verification process (same as any other project proposal).

---

### Corporate Ad Matching

Corporate partners multiply the value of ad-funded contributions by committing matching funds. When users watch ads for projects in a matched category, the per-ad contribution is amplified. This is the simplest mechanism to dramatically increase free-tier user earning power.

**How it works:**

1. A corporate partner commits a matching fund (e.g., $10,000-50,000)
2. The partner specifies matching criteria: all projects, specific categories (education, environment), specific regions, or specific projects
3. When users watch ads for matched projects, the corporate fund adds to the per-ad contribution
4. The match comes from the corporate fund, not from Deluge's cut -- Deluge still keeps 40% of base ad revenue

**Match levels:**

| Match Level | Per-Ad to Project | Monthly (10 ads/day) | Corporate Cost Per Ad |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| No match (current) | $0.009 | $2.70 | $0 |
| 2x match | $0.018 | $5.40 | $0.009 |
| 3x match | $0.027 | $8.10 | $0.018 |
| 5x match | $0.045 | $13.50 | $0.036 |
| 10x match (campaign events) | $0.090 | $27.00 | $0.081 |

At a 5x match, a free-tier user maxing daily ads earns $13.50/month toward projects. At 10x (limited campaigns), $27/month -- enough to fund a microloan contribution in the first month.

**Corporate partner value proposition:**

- Employee engagement: "Your team watches ads, your brand matches the impact"
- Brand visibility: corporate logo on matched project pages, visible in the crediting animation
- ESG reporting: verified impact metrics tied to the corporate matching fund
- Cost efficiency: $25K matching fund at 5x for 500 active ad-watchers lasts ~3.7 months -- comparable to a small corporate volunteer program budget

**Match fund duration and communication:**

Matching campaigns have defined budgets and timeframes. Users are clearly informed: "This project has a 5x match from [Company] -- limited time" or "Match fund: $4,200 remaining." When a match fund is exhausted, contributions return to base rates with clear notification. No false expectation that matching is permanent.

**Economics:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deluge revenue impact | None -- matching doesn't reduce Deluge's 40% cut |
| Average corporate match commitment (est.) | $10K-50K per campaign |
| Match duration at $25K / 5x / 500 users | ~3.7 months |
| New B2B SKU | "Impact Matching Fund" added to corporate ESG product line |

**Funding source:** Corporate ESG budgets. This is a new product in the existing B2B revenue pipeline alongside white-label solutions.

### Combined Free-Tier On-Ramp

With all three mechanisms plus existing ad revenue, a free-tier user's realistic first-month earning potential:

| Mechanism | Monthly Estimate | Availability |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Ads (5/day average) | $1.35 | Daily, passive |
| Referral credits (2-3 friends in first month) | $5.00-7.50 | Front-loaded, first 2-3 months |
| Community grant project (1 small project) | $10-20 | When available, active effort |
| Corporate match on ads (3x average when active) | $2.70 | Campaign-dependent |
| **Combined first-month estimate** | **$19-31** | |

A free-tier user can realistically fund a microloan contribution within their first month. The on-ramp works.

**Long-term earning (after referral exhaustion):**

| Mechanism | Monthly Estimate | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Ads (5/day) | $1.35 | Ongoing baseline |
| Community grant (1 project/month) | $10-20 | Depends on project availability in user's area |
| Corporate match (when active) | $1.35-4.05 | Campaigns come and go |
| **Sustained monthly estimate** | **$13-25** | |

Even after referral credits dry up, the combination of community grants and corporate matching keeps free-tier users at a meaningful earning level. Community grants are the core long-term mechanism because they're community-funded and scale with community size.

## All Revenue Streams

### Primary: Subscriptions

| Scenario | Free Users | Paid Conversion | Avg. Monthly Fee |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Conservative | 85% | 5% | $4.50 (weighted avg) |
| Base | 75% | 10% | $5.00 (weighted avg) |
| Optimistic | 65% | 15% | $5.50 (weighted avg) |

Comparable subscription apps convert 8-12% of signups to paid. Plan around 5-10%.

### Secondary: Attention-Funded Revenue (Video Ads + Business Cards)

Platform keeps ~40% of all attention-funded revenue. The remaining 60% goes directly to community impact projects chosen by users. This includes both video ad views ($0.006/view to Deluge at base) and business card browsing ($0.0008/view to Deluge at base). Video ads generate more per-view; business cards generate more volume per session. Combined, attention-funded revenue reaches $1.7M by Year 5 at base estimates -- 40% of total revenue and the largest revenue category as a group, just behind subscriptions individually.

### Year 2+: B2B Revenue

- Corporate ESG programs: white-label solutions ($10K-50K/year per client)
- Corporate Impact Matching Funds: corporate partners commit matching funds ($10K-50K per campaign) that amplify ad-funded contributions for matched projects. See "Corporate Ad Matching" under Free-Tier Participation Pathways for full economics.
- Realistic Year 2 target: 2-3 clients, not 5-10
- Institutional partnerships take time to develop -- don't count on them early

### Year 2+: Microloan Servicing Fees

- 2% servicing fee on each scheduled loan payment, locked at origination
- Not a primary revenue driver -- estimated $120/month at 100 active loans
- Scales modestly with loan volume: 1,000 active loans at $500 avg could generate ~$1,200/month
- The real value of microloans is mission alignment, user engagement, and recycled impact capital -- not platform revenue

### Year 3+: Credit Bureau Reporting (Cost Center, Not Revenue)

- Credit bureau reporting costs ~$75-120K to implement over Years 2-4
- Ongoing compliance costs ~$5-10K/year
- Does not generate direct revenue, but improves repayment rates by an estimated 5-10%
- Recovered capital from improved repayment recycles through the watershed, increasing cumulative impact
- See "Credit Bureau Reporting (Roadmap)" in the Microloans section for full breakdown

### Long-Term (Speculative)

| Stream | Description | When Realistic |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Success fees | Small % when projects hit milestones | Year 2+ |
| Equity upside | Small stake in innovation startups | Year 4+ (if ever) |

Do not build financial models that depend on speculative revenue.

## Contribution Breakdown

There are two types of contributions on Deluge: cash contributions and attention-funded contributions.

### Cash Contribution ($10 example)

| Destination | Amount | What Happens |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| User's Watershed | $10.00 (100%) | Enters the user's personal impact fund. User deploys to projects or microloans. |

No fees deducted from cash contributions. Minimum contribution: $1. Subscription covers platform costs separately.

### Attention-Funded Contribution (1 ad view, base scenario)

| Allocation | Amount | What Happens |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Deluge (platform) | $0.006 (40%) | Covers ad infrastructure, fraud prevention, platform costs |
| Impact Project | $0.009 (60%) | Goes directly to the user's chosen community project |

*Advertiser paid $0.015. Deluge kept $0.006. The remaining $0.009 went to the project.*

Attention-funded contributions (video ads and business card browsing) flow directly to projects, not through the user's watershed. This keeps the attention-to-impact pathway simple and immediate: watch an ad, fund a project.

**Impact Projects (attention-funded):**
- User chooses which project receives their ad/browsing revenue
- 100% of the project credit goes to the project (no additional fee)
- Verified impact reporting back to user
- Collective attention-funded contributions shown on project pages alongside cash-funded impact

## Microloans & The Watershed

### The Watershed (User Impact Fund)

Every user has a personal watershed -- a fund balance representing their deployable impact capital. The watershed is the central mechanism through which impact dollars flow.

**Money flows in:**

| Source | How |
|--------|-----|
| Cash contributions | 100% of every cash contribution enters the watershed ($1 minimum) |
| Referral credits | Vesting watershed credits earned by referring new active users (funded from marketing budget) |
| Community grant volunteer credit | Watershed credits earned by completing verified community grant work (funded by project contributors) |
| Impact tier Deluge credit | $10/month added to Impact tier subscribers' watersheds (funded from subscription revenue) |
| Loan repayments | When a microloan borrower makes a payment, principal returns to funders' watersheds via share-based repayment |

*Note: Ad-funded contributions and corporate ad matching flow directly to projects, not through the watershed. The watershed holds cash and earned credits that users actively deploy.*

**Money flows out:**

| Destination | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| Grant projects | One-way deployment. Money funds a project and does not return. |
| Microloans | Circular deployment. Funds a borrower. If repaid, principal returns to the watershed. If not, the money is lost (disclosed risk). |

The watershed enables capital recycling. A single dollar of impact capital can fund multiple loans over time if borrowers repay. This is the key economic advantage of microloans over grants: one dollar of impact does work, returns, and does work again.

### Microloan Economics

**Loan structure:**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Loan amounts | $100 (Tier 1) up to $5,000 (Tier 5), based on borrower's credit progression |
| Repayment period | Set by borrower at application within tier limits: T1=6mo, T2=12mo, T3=18mo, T4-5=24mo max |
| Servicing fee | 2% of each scheduled payment, locked at origination, never changes |
| Interest rate | 0% -- there is no interest on microloans, only the servicing fee |
| Share price | $0.25 per share (fixed, universal) |
| Minimum contribution | $0.25 (one share). Fund any amount in $0.25 increments. |
| Shares per loan | Loan amount / $0.25 (e.g., $500 loan = 2,000 shares) |

**Share-based interleaved FIFO disbursement model:**

Every contribution is broken into $0.25 shares. Shares are interleaved round-robin across the repayment queue, with each funder's position within each round determined by their funding time (earliest funder first). The core rule: **no funder receives share N+1 until all active funders have received share N.** This ensures proportional repayment at all times.

Each payment repays the next batch of shares in queue order, distributing small amounts across all active funders. Smaller funders finish first (fewer shares, exit rotation sooner). Larger funders stay in the loan longer. Your money comes back a little at a time -- and that's a feature, not a limitation. It means default risk is proportional (all funders at roughly the same percentage repaid at any point) and smaller contributions finish faster.

Example: $500 loan, $60 monthly payment, 3 funders (among others):

- Funder A (day 1): $50 = 200 shares
- Funder B (day 2): $20 = 80 shares
- Funder C (day 3): $5 = 20 shares
- Other funders: $425 = 1,700 shares
- Total: 2,000 shares

Round-robin interleave order: A, B, C, [others...], A, B, C, [others...], ...

Each $60 payment repays 240 shares. With all funders in rotation, each funder receives repayment proportional to their share of the loan per cycle.

| Payment # | Shares Repaid | A receives | B receives | C receives | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | 240 | ~$6.00 (24 shares) | ~$2.50 (10 shares) | ~$0.50 (2 shares) | All funders active |
| 2 | 240 | ~$6.00 | ~$2.50 | ~$0.50 | C nearing completion |
| ~3 | 240 | ~$6.00 | ~$2.50 | -- | C fully repaid, exits rotation |
| ~5 | 240 | ~$6.50 | -- | -- | B fully repaid, exits rotation |
| ... | 240 | ~$6.75+ | -- | -- | A stays through end of loan |

C (smallest funder) finishes first. A (largest funder) stays through the end. At any point, all active funders have been repaid roughly the same fraction of their contribution.

**Servicing fee revenue:**

| Loan Size | Payment | Fee/Payment (2%) | Total Payments | Total Fee Revenue |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| $100 | $25 | $0.50 | 4 | $2.00 |
| $200 | $40 | $0.80 | 5 | $4.00 |
| $500 | $60 | $1.20 | ~9 | ~$10.80 |
| $1,000 | $100 | $2.00 | 10 | $20.00 |
| $2,000 | $150 | $3.00 | ~14 | ~$42.00 |
| $5,000 | $250 | $5.00 | 20 | $100.00 |

This is not a primary revenue stream. At 100 active loans averaging $500, Deluge collects roughly $120/month in servicing fees. The value of microloans is mission alignment and user engagement, not platform revenue.

**Overpayment incentive structure:**

The 2% servicing fee applies only to the scheduled payment amount. Overpayments above the scheduled amount are fee-free. This directly incentivizes faster repayment:

| Scenario ($500 loan, $60/payment) | Total Fees Paid | Savings |
|------------------------------------|----------------|---------|
| Standard repayment (9 payments) | $10.80 | -- |
| Doubles up every other month (~5 payments) | $6.00 | $4.80 |
| Pays $120/month consistently (~5 payments) | $6.00 | $4.80 |

Fewer payment events = fewer fees. The borrower is rewarded for paying faster, funders get their shares repaid sooner, and everyone benefits.

**Double payment handling:**

When a borrower makes two payments in one period, they choose:

- **Pay next month early** -- treated as a scheduled payment event, fee applies, advances the due date
- **Pay down principal** -- treated as an overpayment, fee-free, enters credit-forward

The choice is the borrower's. Sometimes breathing room matters more than saving on fees.

**Credit-forward mechanics:**

Credit-forward holds sub-$0.25 remainders when a payment doesn't divide evenly into shares. This is a near-trivial edge case under the share model since most payments divide cleanly into $0.25 shares.

- Credit-forward carries no additional fee (already fee-cleared)
- Combines with the next payment to fill additional shares
- Resolves fully at loan completion
- Visible to borrower: "Credit toward next share: $0.15"

**Refinancing:**

Refinancing allows a borrower to adjust their payment amount or extend their term. It is a borrower support tool, not a revenue driver.

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Minimum loan balance for refinancing | $1,000. Below this, loans are small enough that the original payment should be manageable. |
| Refinancing fee | 1% of remaining loan balance, or $10 minimum, whichever is greater |
| When available | Any time during an active loan, or during default to enable recovery |
| Purpose | Make payments affordable, avoid or recover from default |
| Effect on share queue | No change -- funders keep their shares and rotation positions |
| Effect on term limits | Refinancing can exceed the tier's original term cap. Term limits apply at origination, not post-refinance. |

**Why $1,000 minimum:** Loans below $1,000 have payments small enough that refinancing adds administrative overhead without meaningful benefit. A $500 loan at $60/month doesn't need refinancing -- the 3-payment recovery path ($180 total) or full payoff is the appropriate tool.

**Why $10 minimum fee:** At 1% of remaining balance, small loans generate sub-dollar fees that cost more to process than they're worth. The $10 minimum ensures refinancing covers its own administrative cost. For a $1,000 remaining balance, 1% = $10 (meets minimum). For a $2,000 remaining balance, 1% = $20 (exceeds minimum).

**When refinancing makes sense:**
- Borrower can't afford the original payment amount on a $1,000+ loan and wants to avoid default
- Borrower is in default on a $1,000+ loan and needs a lower payment to achieve the 3-consecutive-payment recovery threshold
- Borrower's circumstances changed (job loss, reduced income) and a temporary adjustment prevents a worse outcome

**Revenue impact:** At 1% of remaining balance with a $10 minimum, a $1,500 remaining balance generates a $15 refinancing fee. This is modest but covers the administrative cost of processing the refinance. Deluge should not depend on refinancing fees as a meaningful revenue stream -- the value is in keeping borrowers repaying rather than defaulting.

**Credit progression tiers:**

| Tier | Max Loan | Requirement |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | $100 | Verified Deluge account |
| 2 | $500 | 1 loan repaid in full, on time |
| 3 | $1,000 | 2 loans repaid, ≤1 late payment total |
| 4 | $2,000 | 3+ loans repaid, strong history |
| 5 | $5,000 | Established track record |

Progression is earned through repayment behavior, not dollar amounts borrowed.

**Default rates and risk:**

Microloan default rates vary widely depending on vetting and support systems. Kiva reports ~3% historical default. Without a partner network doing in-person vetting, Deluge should plan conservatively:

| Scenario | Default Rate | Impact on Funders |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Optimistic | 5% | 1 in 20 loans loses funder capital |
| Base | 10% | 1 in 10 loans loses funder capital |
| Conservative | 15% | ~1 in 7 loans loses funder capital |

At a 10% default rate with average $500 loans, a funder who backs 10 loans ($200 total) would expect to lose ~$20 to defaults and recover ~$180 to their watershed. The recovered $180 can be redeployed, so one cycle of $200 deployed does roughly $380 in total lending over two cycles. Impact capital multiplies despite defaults.

**Default recovery & credit rehabilitation economics:**

Default is not necessarily permanent. A borrower can exit default by making 3 consecutive on-time payments or paying off the remaining balance in full. On recovery, the borrower's credit is halved (rounded down to nearest $5, minimum $25).

**Impact on recycled capital:**
- A recovered default still caused delay and disruption -- funders waited longer for repayment, and some of their shares may have already been written off as losses
- But eventually, capital returns to the system: the borrower resumes payments, funders resume receiving disbursements, and the watershed refills
- The credit halving means the borrower's next loan is smaller, which reduces the amount at risk in their next cycle
- The $25 minimum floor means even worst-case borrowers (multiple defaults and recoveries) can still participate in the system with a loan amount large enough to fund something real -- nobody is permanently excluded

**Adjusted recycled capital with recovery scenarios (base, 10% default rate, 30% recovery rate among defaults):**

| Year | Defaults | Recovered Defaults | Capital Eventually Returned | Net Lost |
|------|----------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| 3 | $8,000 | $2,400 (30%) | ~$2,000 (partial -- recovery takes time) | ~$6,000 |
| 4 | $25,000 | $7,500 | ~$6,000 | ~$19,000 |
| 5 | $60,000 | $18,000 | ~$15,000 | ~$45,000 |

Recovery doesn't eliminate default losses, but it meaningfully reduces them. A 30% recovery rate among defaults improves the effective default rate from 10% to ~7%, which compounds favorably as recycled capital grows.

**Credit halving worked examples (economics perspective):**

| Borrower Scenario | Credit Before | Credit After Recovery | Next Loan Max | Risk Reduction |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Tier 3 borrower defaults | $1,000 | $500 | $500 | 50% less capital at risk |
| Tier 2 borrower defaults | $500 | $250 | $250 | 50% less capital at risk |
| Tier 1 borrower defaults | $100 | $50 | $50 | 50% less capital at risk |
| Repeated defaulter | $50 | $25 | $25 | At floor |
| Floor borrower | $25 | $25 | $25 | Minimum participation preserved |

**Recycled capital projections (base scenario):**

| Year | Active Loans | Avg Loan Size | Total Deployed | Repaid & Recycled | Cumulative Impact |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2 | 50 | $300 | $15,000 | $10,000 | $25,000 |
| 3 | 200 | $400 | $80,000 | $55,000 | $135,000 |
| 4 | 500 | $500 | $250,000 | $180,000 | $430,000 |
| 5 | 1,000 | $600 | $600,000 | $450,000 | $1,050,000 |

"Cumulative Impact" counts every dollar deployed, including recycled capital. One dollar flowing through two loan cycles counts as $2 of impact. This is the multiplier effect: grants deploy once, loans deploy repeatedly.

### Sponsorship (Community-Backed Credit Extension)

Sponsorship allows community members to vouch for a borrower, extending the borrower's credit limit beyond their earned tier. Sponsorship is a reputation-based system -- sponsors do not stake their own watershed funds, but their platform track record determines how much credit they can extend.

**How sponsorship power works:**

```
sponsorship_power = base_contributions × multiplier
```

- `base_contributions` = total dollars the sponsor has contributed to the platform (cash contributions + ad contributions)
- `multiplier` = track_record_ratio × (100% + volume_bonus), capped at 200%
- `track_record_ratio` = total_repaid_value / total_completed_value (portfolio-weighted across all sponsored loans)
- `volume_bonus` = grows with successful sponsorship history, up to +100%

A sponsor who has contributed $1,000 to the platform with a perfect track record and maximum volume bonus can extend up to $2,000 in credit (200% of base).

**Sponsorship power examples:**

| Sponsor Profile | Base Contributions | Track Record | Volume Bonus | Multiplier | Sponsorship Power |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| New sponsor (first 3 loans) | $500 | 100% (learning period) | 0% | 100% | $500 |
| Established, clean record | $1,000 | 100% | 30% | 130% | $1,300 |
| Veteran, one small default | $2,000 | 95% | 50% | 143% | $2,850 |
| Veteran, perfect record | $2,000 | 100% | 80% | 180% | $3,600 |
| Maximum power | $5,000 | 100% | 100% | 200% | $10,000 |

**Default impact on sponsors (portfolio-weighted):**

When a sponsored loan defaults, the sponsor's track record ratio decreases proportionally to the defaulted amount relative to their total completed sponsorship volume. This means a single small default against a large portfolio of successful sponsorships barely moves the needle.

| Scenario | Total Completed | Default Amount | Track Record Ratio | Impact |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| $100 default, $10,000 in successful sponsorships | $10,100 | $100 | 99% | Minimal |
| $500 default, $2,000 in successful sponsorships | $2,500 | $500 | 80% | Moderate |
| $500 default, $500 in successful sponsorships | $1,000 | $500 | 50% | Severe |

This is designed to feel fair, not punitive. A sponsor with a long track record of good judgment doesn't lose their reputation over one misjudgment.

**Recovery via aggregate counteraction:**

A sponsor can recover from defaults by successfully sponsoring new loans totaling 2x the defaulted amount (aggregate across any combination of loans). Once the counteraction threshold is met, the defaulted loan is marked as counteracted and stops dragging down the track record ratio.

Example: A sponsor has $500 in defaults. They need $1,000 in new successfully repaid sponsorships (any combination -- two $500 loans, five $200 loans, etc.) to fully counteract the damage.

**Sponsorship economics for the platform:**

Sponsorship itself generates no direct revenue. Its value is indirect:

| Indirect Benefit | How It Helps |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Larger loans enabled | Higher credit limits → larger loans → more servicing fee revenue per loan |
| Community engagement | Sponsors are deeply invested users who stay on the platform |
| Better repayment rates | Social accountability -- borrowers with sponsors have someone vouching for them |
| User retention | Both sponsors and borrowers have stronger reasons to remain active |

**Estimated impact on servicing fee revenue (base scenario):**

| Year | Loans Enabled by Sponsorship | Avg Sponsored Loan Size | Additional Servicing Fees |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 2 | 10 | $600 | ~$120 |
| 3 | 50 | $800 | ~$800 |
| 4 | 150 | $1,000 | ~$3,000 |
| 5 | 400 | $1,200 | ~$9,600 |

Sponsorship won't move the revenue needle in early years. By Year 5, sponsored loans could contribute meaningfully to servicing fee volume -- but the real value remains community engagement and mission alignment.

**Concurrent loan sponsorship economics:**

When sponsors enable a concurrent second loan, their sponsorship power is halved for that sponsorship. This reflects the higher risk of a borrower managing two loans simultaneously.

| Sponsor Profile | Full Power | Power for Concurrent Sponsorship | Effect |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------------|--------|
| New sponsor ($500 power) | $500 | $250 | Can cover less of a concurrent loan |
| Established ($1,300 power) | $1,300 | $650 | Requires larger sponsor commitment or multiple sponsors |
| Veteran ($3,600 power) | $3,600 | $1,800 | Still substantial, but naturally limited |
| Maximum ($10,000 power) | $10,000 | $5,000 | Even maximum sponsors extend less credit for concurrent loans |

**Sponsor-upward uses full power:** When a sponsor vouches to increase an existing active loan (same loan, same purpose, same borrower), sponsorship power applies at the full rate. The rationale: increasing a single loan is lower risk than enabling a second concurrent loan. The borrower is already managing one obligation; adding to it is simpler than splitting attention across two.

**Risk considerations:**

- Sponsored loans carry higher default risk than organically-earned tier loans (borrower hasn't proven repayment at that level)
- Conservative estimate: sponsored loan default rate 15-20% vs. 10% for tier-earned loans
- Concurrent loans carry the highest risk -- two obligations increase the chance of default on both
- Conservative estimate: concurrent loan default rate 20-25%
- Sponsor reputation system provides a natural check -- sponsors with bad track records lose sponsorship power
- Platform should monitor sponsored loan default rates separately (standard, upward, concurrent) and adjust if the gap widens
- Sponsor track record retroactively restores when a defaulted loan recovers -- sponsors aren't permanently penalized for borrowers who eventually make good

### Credit Bureau Reporting (Roadmap)

Reporting microloan repayment to credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax) transforms Deluge microloans from a community tool into a real credit-building pathway. This is a major differentiator for borrowers who need conventional credit (mortgages, auto loans, credit cards) but lack credit history.

**Why this matters:**

- ~45 million Americans are "credit invisible" (no credit score) or "unscorable"
- Successfully repaying a Deluge microloan builds real credit history
- This makes the microloan program genuinely life-changing, not just a nice community feature
- Attracts borrowers who are motivated to repay (credit score is a powerful incentive)

**Implementation roadmap:**

| Phase | Timing | What | Cost Estimate |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Research & legal | Year 2 | FCRA compliance review, Metro 2 format research, credit bureau partnership requirements | $15-25K (legal fees) |
| Partnership | Year 2-3 | Establish data furnisher agreements with at least 2 bureaus | $10-20K (setup fees) + ongoing compliance |
| Integration | Year 3 | Build Metro 2 reporting pipeline, dispute resolution system, compliance monitoring | $50-75K (engineering) |
| Launch | Year 3-4 | Begin reporting for new loans, backfill eligible existing loans | Ongoing compliance costs ~$5-10K/year |

**Total estimated cost: $75-120K over Years 2-4.**

**Compliance requirements (FCRA):**

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Accuracy | Must report accurately; errors create legal liability |
| Dispute resolution | Must investigate and resolve borrower disputes within 30 days |
| Data format | Metro 2 format (industry standard for credit reporting) |
| Consent | Borrower must consent to credit reporting at loan origination |
| Opt-in model | Borrowers choose whether their loan is credit-reported (recommended approach) |

**Impact on the business model:**

| Effect | How |
|--------|-----|
| Improved repayment rates | Borrowers protecting their credit score are more likely to repay -- estimated 5-10% improvement in repayment rates |
| Stronger borrower acquisition | "Build your credit with a 0% interest microloan" is a compelling value proposition |
| Higher engagement | Borrowers checking credit progress creates recurring app visits |
| Mission alignment | Genuinely helping people build financial futures, not just deploying capital |
| Platform differentiation | Few community lending platforms offer credit bureau reporting |

**Revenue impact:** Credit bureau reporting doesn't directly generate revenue, but improved repayment rates mean less capital lost to defaults and more recycled through the watershed. At a 5% improvement in repayment rates on the base scenario, approximately $22K in additional capital would be recovered and recycled by Year 5.

This feature should not be rushed. FCRA compliance is serious -- inaccurate reporting creates real legal exposure. Plan for Year 3-4 launch with thorough legal preparation starting in Year 2.

## Project Tags & Categories

Projects are organized by **tags**, not rigid categories. Tags are flexible labels that help users discover projects. A single project can have multiple tags (e.g., "education" + "local" + "youth" + "Denver").

The community drives what gets funded. Deluge verifies legitimacy and tracks impact, but does not curate or editorialize which projects deserve funding.

### Starter Tags (Platform Launch)

**Measurable returns:** Housing units created, families housed, facility usage rates, food insecurity reduction.

### 6. Health & Wellness

- Community health clinics in underserved areas
- Mental health services (counseling, crisis support)
- Fitness programs (community gyms, youth sports)
- Nutrition programs (healthy food access, education)

### 7. Arts, Culture & Community

- Public art projects (murals, sculptures, performances)
- Cultural preservation (historic sites, traditions, languages)
- Youth arts programs (music, theater, visual arts)
- Libraries and museums
- Community events (festivals, celebrations)

**Measurable returns:** Artworks created, events hosted, youth participation, community engagement, tourism/economic impact.

## Community Dynamics & Network Effects

Deluge's long-term defensibility depends on community network effects -- the compounding value that makes the platform harder to replicate as it grows. This section analyzes how community dynamics drive business metrics and where the moat builds.

### How Community Size Affects Cascade Rate

A cascade (project fully funded) is the core emotional event on the platform. Cascades create shareable moments, drive re-engagement, and prove the platform works. Cascade frequency is directly tied to community size.

| Community Size | Avg. Project Funding Goal | Monthly Contribution Pool (cash + ad contributions) | Projects Fundable Per Month | Cascade Frequency |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 100 members | $2,000 | ~$500 | 0.25 (1 every 4 months) | Too slow -- users lose faith |
| 500 members | $3,000 | ~$3,000 | 1 | Minimum viable -- monthly cascades |
| 2,000 members | $5,000 | ~$15,000 | 3 | Healthy -- weekly or biweekly |
| 10,000 members | $10,000 | ~$80,000 | 8 | Strong -- multiple per week |

**The 500-member threshold is critical.** Below 500 members, a community can't fund a meaningful project within a reasonable timeframe. Users who join a sub-500 community see stalled projects and leave. This means Deluge must seed communities to 500 members before they become self-sustaining. Early-stage strategy should concentrate users in fewer, denser communities rather than spreading them across many small ones.

### Network Effects by Type

| Effect | Mechanism | Strength | When It Kicks In |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Same-side (community)** | More members → more projects proposed → more interesting options → more members join | Strong | 500+ members per community |
| **Cross-side (projects ↔ funders)** | More funders → more projects get funded → more proposers submit → more funders see results | Strong | 50+ funded projects on the platform |
| **Cross-side (businesses ↔ browsers)** | More business listings → more useful directory → more browsing → more businesses list | Moderate | 30+ businesses per market |
| **Data network effect** | More users → better project recommendations, better impact data, better ad targeting | Weak initially, strong at scale | 50K+ users |
| **Social / referral** | Users invite friends → friends join same communities → community grows → more value for everyone | Strong | From Day 1 |

### Community as a Retention Moat

Users who join a community and see a cascade are significantly harder to churn than solo users.

| User Type | Expected 90-Day Retention | Why |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----|
| Solo user (no community) | 15-20% | No social ties. Feels like any other charity app. |
| Community member (no cascade seen) | 25-35% | Social connection, but no proof the model works. |
| Community member (saw a cascade) | 40-55% | Emotional proof that collective action produces real outcomes. |
| Community member (contributed to a cascade) | 55-70% | Personal stake in a visible outcome. This is the retention goldmine. |

**Implication:** Getting users to their first cascade contribution as fast as possible is the single most important retention lever. Onboarding should funnel users into active communities with near-term cascade potential, not into empty or early-stage communities.

### Community Health Indicators

These metrics predict whether a community will thrive or stall.

| Indicator | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Active members (monthly) | > 40% of total members | 20-40% | < 20% -- community is dying |
| Projects proposed (monthly) | 2+ per 500 members | 1 per 500 | 0 -- no one is proposing. Needs seeding. |
| Cascade rate | 1+ per month per 500 members | 1 every 2-3 months | < 1 per quarter -- users losing faith |
| Discussion activity | Daily posts/comments | Weekly | Monthly or less -- community is a ghost town |
| New member growth | 5%+ monthly | 1-5% | Negative -- community is shrinking |

### Competitive Moat Assessment

| Moat Component | Replicability | Time to Build | Strength |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| Technology (app, payment processing) | Easy -- any funded startup can build this | 3-6 months | Weak |
| Community relationships | Hard -- trust and social ties take time | 2-3 years | Strong |
| Project history + impact data | Hard -- verified outcomes compound over time | 2-4 years | Strong |
| Local business directory | Moderate -- requires market-by-market effort | 1-2 years per market | Moderate |
| Borrower credit history + sponsorship networks | Very hard -- reputation systems can't be copied | 3-5 years | Very strong |
| Brand association with sustainable giving | Moderate -- first-mover advantage matters | 1-2 years | Moderate |

**The real moat is the community graph + impact history.** A competitor can clone the app in 12 months, but they can't replicate 3 years of funded projects, verified outcomes, community relationships, borrower credit histories, and sponsor reputation scores. Every cascade, every repaid loan, every verified community grant adds to a data and trust asset that compounds.

### What Happens If a Major Competitor Enters

If GoFundMe, a major tech platform, or a well-funded startup launches a competing community giving feature:

| Scenario | Deluge's Defense |
|----------|-----------------|
| Competitor adds "community giving" to existing app | Deluge's community-driven model is philosophically different from tacked-on charity features. A "donate" button doesn't compete with a giving-first platform with watershed mechanics, cascades, microloans, and community grants. The community, project history, and cascade dynamics don't transfer. |
| Competitor launches community-funded projects | Takes 12+ months to build community density. Deluge's head start in specific markets (500+ member communities, funded projects, impact data) creates a switching cost for users with community ties. |
| Competitor offers free-tier giving through ads | Deluge's multi-pathway model (ads + business cards + volunteering + referrals) is broader. The combined free-tier on-ramp is harder to replicate than any single mechanism. |
| Well-funded clone launches | The biggest risk. Mitigate by building community density fast in initial markets, creating strong brand identity, and making community switching costs high (project history, achievements, sponsorship reputation). |

## Unit Economics

### Per User (Year 1 Assumptions -- Conservative)

**Average cash contribution per user:** $30 total in Year 1 (not $75)
- Initial: $5-10
- Monthly additions: $2-3
- Many users will try it once or twice, then contribute primarily through ads
- Some users contribute only through ads and volunteering ($0 in cash)
- Cash contributions are pure giving -- users won't contribute as much as they would invest in themselves

**Platform revenue per user (blended across all user types):**

| Source | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Subscription revenue (blended) | $2.70/yr | $6.00/yr | $9.90/yr |
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% cut (avg 2 ads/day across all users) | $1.75/yr | $3.50/yr | $5.84/yr |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% cut (blended ~1.5 views/day in Year 1) | $0.22/yr | $0.44/yr | $0.88/yr |
| **Total Year 1 per user** | **$4.67** | **$9.94** | **$16.62** |

*Blended subscription = (% paid users) x (avg monthly fee) x 12.*
*Video ad revenue = avg views/day x 365 x eCPM rate x 40% platform cut. Most users watch 0-3 ads/day; blended average ~2/day.*
*Business card revenue = blended browsing activity x 365 x per-view rate x 40% platform cut. Year 1 is low -- the business card directory launches market-by-market with limited listings. Per-user revenue grows as more markets and businesses join (estimated $0.80/yr in Year 2, $1.20/yr in Year 3, $1.50/yr in Year 4, $1.80/yr in Year 5).*
*Note: Cash contributions feed the watershed and fund projects/microloans but do not generate platform revenue. Platform revenue comes from subscriptions, ads, business cards, and corporate partnerships.*

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**

| Channel | Cost | Reality Check |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Paid ads (Facebook/Instagram) | $15-30 per signup | Social impact app avg is $15-40 |
| Paid ads (Google) | $25-50 per signup | Competitive keywords |
| Organic (content, PR, word-of-mouth) | $3-8 per signup | Requires strong content and brand |
| Referral program | $2.50-3.00 per signup | Watershed credits from marketing budget; most cost-efficient channel |
| **Blended average** | **$12-22** | Assumes 25% referral, 20% organic, 55% paid |

Referral credits are the cheapest acquisition channel by a wide margin. At $2.75 per acquired user versus $20+ for paid ads, every referral saves $17+ in marketing spend. The blended CAC drops from $15-25 (without referrals) to $12-22 as the referral program scales. This is why the referral program is funded from the marketing budget -- it's a direct substitution for more expensive paid acquisition.

**Lifetime Value (LTV) -- 3-Year:**

| Scenario | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | 3-Year LTV |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Conservative | $2.92 | $5.71 | $8.41 | $17.04 |
| Base | $6.44 | $12.61 | $18.82 | $37.87 |
| Optimistic | $10.78 | $21.41 | $32.02 | $64.21 |

*Includes business card revenue growing from Year 1 through Year 3 as the directory expands to more markets.*

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**

| Scenario | LTV | CAC | Ratio | Viable? |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|---------|
| Conservative | $17 | $22 | 0.8:1 | No -- still needs organic growth to work |
| Base | $38 | $17 | 2.2:1 | Viable -- referral program makes the math work |
| Optimistic | $64 | $12 | 5.3:1 | Healthy |

**Key insight:** The referral program and business card revenue meaningfully improve unit economics. At conservative estimates, paid-only acquisition still doesn't work -- but the gap is smaller. At base estimates, the referral program's impact on blended CAC (pulling it from $20 down to $17) is what pushes the LTV:CAC ratio past the 2:1 viability threshold. This underscores why the referral program isn't optional -- it's the mechanism that makes the unit economics close.

## Financial Projections (5-Year, Three Scenarios)

### User Growth

| Year | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|------|-------------|------|-----------|
| 1 | 3,000 | 8,000 | 15,000 |
| 2 | 10,000 | 30,000 | 60,000 |
| 3 | 25,000 | 75,000 | 150,000 |
| 4 | 50,000 | 150,000 | 300,000 |
| 5 | 80,000 | 250,000 | 500,000 |

### Year 1 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Subscriptions (800 paid x $5/mo x 12) | $48K |
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% (8K users x $3.50/yr blended) | $28K |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% (8K users x $0.44/yr blended) | $3.5K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$80K** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Legal/compliance (entity formation, money transmission, charitable solicitation) | $45K |
| Technology (MVP build + ad platform integration) | $130K |
| Marketing (includes ~$4K referral credits) | $35K |
| Operations | $25K |
| **Total Costs** | **$235K** |

| **Net** | **-$155K** |
|---------|------------|

Year 1 is a build year in every scenario. There is no path to Year 1 profitability -- the user base is too small. Legal costs are significantly lower than a fintech model: no securities regulation, no broker-dealer partnership, no state investment registrations. The remaining legal burden is entity formation, money transmission analysis (mitigated by using Stripe/PayPal), and charitable solicitation review. Business card revenue is negligible in Year 1 because the directory launches market-by-market with limited listings.

### Year 2 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Subscriptions (3,000 paid x $5/mo x 12) | $180K |
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% (30K users x $3.75/yr blended) | $113K |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% (30K users x $0.80/yr blended) | $24K |
| Corporate ESG + Impact Matching Funds (2 clients x $15K) | $30K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$347K** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Legal/compliance (ongoing) | $35K |
| Technology (maintenance + features + ad ops) | $130K |
| Marketing (includes ~$8K referral credits) | $90K |
| Operations | $50K |
| Team (3 FTE) | $240K |
| **Total Costs** | **$545K** |

| **Net** | **-$198K** |
|---------|------------|

### Year 3 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Subscriptions (7,500 paid x $5.50/mo x 12) | $495K |
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% (75K users x $4.00/yr blended) | $300K |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% (75K users x $1.20/yr blended) | $90K |
| Corporate ESG + Impact Matching Funds (5 clients x $25K) | $125K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$1.01M** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Legal/compliance | $50K |
| Technology (includes ad platform + business directory scaling) | $180K |
| Marketing (includes ~$19K referral credits) | $180K |
| Operations | $80K |
| Team (6 FTE) | $480K |
| **Total Costs** | **$970K** |

| **Net** | **+$40K** (approaching break-even) |
|---------|------------|

### Year 4 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Subscriptions (15,000 paid x $6/mo x 12) | $1.08M |
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% (150K users x $4.50/yr blended) | $675K |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% (150K users x $1.50/yr blended) | $225K |
| Corporate ESG + Impact Matching Funds (10 clients x $35K) | $350K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$2.33M** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| **Total Costs** | **$1.55M** |

| **Net** | **+$780K** (solidly profitable) |
|---------|------------|

### Year 5 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Subscriptions (25,000 paid x $6.50/mo x 12) | $1.95M |
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% (250K users x $5.00/yr blended) | $1.25M |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% (250K users x $1.80/yr blended) | $450K |
| Corporate ESG + Impact Matching Funds (15 clients x $40K) | $600K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$4.25M** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| **Total Costs** | **$2.1M** |

| **Net** | **+$2.15M** |
|---------|------------|

### Cumulative Funding Needed (Base Scenario)

| Through Year | Cumulative Loss | Total Capital Needed |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Year 1 | -$155K | $250K (includes buffer) |
| Year 2 | -$353K | $450K |
| Year 3 | -$313K | $450K (Year 3 approaches break-even) |
| Year 4 | +$467K | Funded from operations |
| Year 5 | +$2.62M | Profitable |

**Reality check:** Without investment infrastructure, Deluge's cost structure is dramatically simpler. No securities lawyers, no broker-dealer partnerships, no fintech co-founder, no investment compliance. The base scenario requires approximately **$500-700K in total capital** to reach break-even in Year 3, with solid profitability from Year 4. Combined attention-funded revenue (video ads + business cards) reaches $1.7M in Year 5, representing 40% of total revenue and the largest revenue category as a group. Business card revenue grows from negligible in Year 1 to $450K by Year 5 as the directory expands across markets. Referral credits reduce marketing spend per acquisition but are funded from the existing marketing budget, not a separate line item.

## Scenario Summary

| Metric (Year 5) | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|-----------------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Users | 80,000 | 250,000 | 500,000 |
| Annual Revenue (subs + ads + biz cards + B2B) | $500K | $4.25M | $10.3M |
| Attention-funded revenue (video ads + business cards) | $200K | $1.7M | $3.8M |
| Profitable? | No (marginal) | Yes (Year 3-4) | Yes (Year 2-3) |
| Total capital needed | $1.0M+ (marginal viability) | $500-700K | $350K |

---

## Revenue Model Stress Test

The base scenario projects $4.25M in Year 5 revenue across four streams. But several of those streams are speculative -- particularly business card revenue, corporate matching, and the referral program's impact on CAC. This section tests what happens when individual streams underperform, and identifies which ones are load-bearing vs. supplementary.

### Year 5 Base Revenue Breakdown (Reference)

| Stream | Amount | % of Total | Category |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Subscriptions | $1.95M | 45.9% | Proven subscription model |
| Video ad revenue | $1.25M | 29.4% | Moderate confidence (depends on eCPM) |
| Business card revenue | $450K | 10.6% | Speculative (new, unproven format) |
| Corporate ESG + matching | $600K | 14.1% | Speculative (B2B sales required) |
| **Total** | **$4.25M** | **100%** | |

Year 5 costs: $2.1M. Base net: +$2.15M.

### Individual Stream Stress Tests

Each scenario cuts one revenue stream by 50% while holding everything else constant.

| Scenario | What Underperforms | Year 4 Net | Year 5 Net | Still Profitable Year 4? | Impact |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Base (reference)** | Nothing | +$780K | +$2.15M | Yes | -- |
| **A: Business cards at 50%** | Directory grows slower, fewer markets, lower browse rates | +$667K | +$1.93M | Yes | Low -- supplementary stream |
| **B: Corporate matching at 50%** | Fewer corporate partners, smaller fund commitments | +$605K | +$1.85M | Yes | Low -- Year 2+ revenue, not launch-critical |
| **C: Video ad eCPM at 50%** | Ad rates come in at $7-8 CPM instead of $15 | +$442K | +$1.53M | Yes | Moderate -- second-largest stream |
| **D: Subscriptions at 50%** | Paid conversion 5% instead of 10% | +$240K | +$1.18M | Yes (thin) | High -- largest stream, core model risk |

**Conclusion from individual tests:** No single stream at 50% kills the business. Subscriptions at 50% is the most dangerous -- it pushes Year 4 to thin profitability and signals a fundamental pricing problem. Everything else has manageable impact.

### Combined Stress Tests

Real-world underperformance rarely hits one stream in isolation. These scenarios combine multiple headwinds.

**Scenario F: All speculative streams at 50%**

Business cards and corporate matching both underperform by 50%. Subscriptions and video ads hold at base.

| Year | Base Revenue | Adjusted Revenue | Base Costs | Net |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|-----|
| Year 4 | $2.33M | $2.04M | $1.55M | +$490K |
| Year 5 | $4.25M | $3.73M | $2.1M | +$1.63M |

Still profitable in Year 4, with a thinner margin. The business survives because subscriptions and video ads -- the two largest streams -- are intact.

**Scenario G: Ad ecosystem underperforms (eCPM at 50% across video AND business cards)**

Lower-than-expected ad rates affect both video ads and business card revenue simultaneously, since both depend on advertiser willingness to pay for the audience.

| Year | Base Revenue | Adjusted Revenue | Base Costs | Net |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|-----|
| Year 4 | $2.33M | $1.88M | $1.55M | +$330K |
| Year 5 | $4.25M | $3.4M | $2.1M | +$1.3M |

Still profitable in Year 4 with a thinner margin. The business survives but is more dependent on subscription growth and B2B revenue to carry it.

**Scenario H: Referral program fails + higher CAC**

Referrals don't materialize. Blended CAC reverts from $12-22 to $15-25 (pre-referral estimates). This is a cost increase, not a revenue decrease -- roughly $3-5 per user acquired.

| Year | Additional Marketing Cost | Base Net | Adjusted Net |
|------|--------------------------|---------|-------------|
| Year 3 (+45K new users) | +$135K-225K | +$40K | -$95K to -$185K |
| Year 4 (+75K new users) | +$225K-375K | +$780K | +$405K to +$555K |
| Year 5 (+100K new users) | +$300K-500K | +$2.15M | +$1.65M to +$1.85M |

Still profitable in Year 4, but Year 3 reverts to a loss. Total capital needed increases from $500-700K to $700K-1.0M. The referral program isn't revenue -- it's cost efficiency. Losing it doesn't kill the business, but it extends the runway needed to profitability.

**Scenario I: Worst case -- ad eCPM at 50% + no corporate matching + referral program fails**

Three headwinds simultaneously: attention-funded revenue halved, corporate matching revenue zeroed, and user acquisition costs revert to pre-referral levels.

| Year | Base Revenue | Adjusted Revenue | Base Costs | Adjusted Costs | Net |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Year 4 | $2.33M | $1.53M | $1.55M | $1.75M | -$220K |
| Year 5 | $4.25M | $2.8M | $2.1M | $2.4M | +$400K |

**Year 4 is not profitable under worst case.** Profitability delays to Year 5 (thin margin). Total capital needed increases to ~$1.0-1.3M. This is survivable with additional funding but no longer a base-case business.

### Load-Bearing vs. Supplementary Streams

| Stream | Classification | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Subscriptions** | **Load-bearing** | Largest stream (46%). At 50%, Year 4 becomes thin. If subscription conversion fails, the core business model is wrong. |
| **Video ad revenue** | **Load-bearing** | Second-largest stream (29%). Halving it compresses margins significantly. Combined with other headwinds, it pushes profitability out further. |
| **Business card revenue** | **Supplementary** | Only 11% of Year 5 revenue. At 50% or even 0%, the business still works. Nice upside, not a dependency. |
| **Corporate ESG + matching** | **Supplementary** | 14% of revenue, and it's Year 2+ anyway. Delayed or halved, the impact is manageable. Don't build financial plans around it. |
| **Referral program (cost efficiency)** | **Important but not fatal** | Failing referrals don't reduce revenue but increase costs by $300-500K over Years 3-5. Extends runway needed by ~$300K. Worth investing in but not a single point of failure. |

### What This Means for Prioritization

1. **Subscription conversion is the #1 business risk.** If users won't pay $3-12/month, nothing else matters. Phase 0 validation of willingness to pay is the most important test.
2. **Video ad eCPM is the #2 risk.** The platform works at half the projected eCPM, but margins get thin. Validate eCPM assumptions early (Phase 0, Test 7) and have a fallback plan (direct-sold sponsorship ads from mission-aligned brands).
3. **Business card revenue and corporate matching are gravy.** Model them conservatively. Don't hire against them. If they outperform, reinvest. If they underperform, the core business still works.
4. **The referral program is a cost lever, not a revenue lever.** Invest in it because it dramatically improves unit economics, but don't assume it works when projecting capital needs. Budget for the higher CAC and treat referral savings as upside.

---

## Funding Requirements (Revised)

### Bootstrap Path

| Phase | Funding Source | Amount |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Phase 0 | Self-funded | $2,000-5,000 |
| Phase 1 | Self-funded or friends/family | $50-100K |
| Phase 2 | Angel round (15-25% equity) | $250-500K |
| Phase 3 | Series A or revenue-funded | $1-3M |

### Venture Path

| Round | Amount | Timing | What It Proves |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Pre-seed | $150-300K | After validation (Phase 0) | People want this |
| Seed | $500K-1M | After MVP + 1,000 users | Product works |
| Series A | $3-7M | After 30K+ users, clear retention | Business works |

### Total to Launch (Revised, Honest)

| Phase | Cost | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Phase 0 (Validation) | $2,000-5,000 | Landing page, ads, survey |
| Phase 1 (Legal + Setup) | $30,000-70,000 | Entity formation, money transmission analysis, charitable solicitation review, privacy/terms |
| Phase 2 (MVP Build) | $100,000-200,000 | Engineering, design, QA, payment integration (Stripe/PayPal) |
| Phase 3 (Launch + Runway) | $150,000-400,000 | Marketing, team, 6-12 month runway |
| **Total to Launch + Survive Year 1** | **$280K-675K** |

Without investment infrastructure, Deluge avoids the regulatory complexity of a fintech product. No securities lawyers, no broker-dealer integration, no state investment registrations. The remaining legal requirements (entity formation, money transmission via payment processors, charitable solicitation review) are significantly cheaper and faster. The giving-only model can reach MVP in 3-5 months versus 6-9 months for an investment platform.

---

## Key Assumptions to Validate in Phase 0

These are the make-or-break questions. If any answer is "no," the model needs to change.

1. **Does "community-driven giving" resonate as a concept?** (Will people sign up for a platform focused on transparent, collective community giving?)
2. **Will users watch ads to fund community projects?** (Is "donate your attention" compelling enough to drive daily engagement?)
3. **Will people pay $3-12/month for a giving platform?** (Or do they expect community giving tools to be free?)
4. **Is the CAC achievable below $20?** (If not, unit economics don't work)
5. **Can we retain 30%+ MAU after Month 3?** (Most apps lose 70-80% of users in 90 days)
6. **Can we achieve $8-15 eCPM consistently?** (Ad rates fluctuate seasonally and by market conditions)
7. **Will users refer friends for watershed credits?** (Referral programs only work if the product is worth recommending -- credits alone don't drive sharing)
8. **Will communities propose and fund sweat equity projects?** (Requires both people willing to post needs AND people willing to volunteer -- two-sided marketplace dynamics)
9. **Can we sign corporate partners for ad matching funds?** (ESG budgets exist, but is "match ad-funded community impact" a compelling enough product to sell?)

---

## Phase 0 Validation Plan

Phase 0 costs $900-2,000 and happens before any code is written. The goal is to kill bad assumptions cheaply. Each test below is ordered by priority: the first failures should stop the project or force a fundamental pivot before money is spent on later tests.

### Test Sequence

Tests are grouped into three waves. Each wave should produce clear pass/fail signals before committing to the next.

#### Wave 1: Core Concept (Weeks 1-3, ~$500-1,000)

These test whether the fundamental value proposition resonates. If these fail, nothing else matters.

**Test 1: Core Concept Resonance**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Does "community-driven giving where small contributions add up to fund real projects" resonate? |
| Method | Landing page A/B test. Version A: "Fund what matters in your community. Give cash or give attention. See exactly where it goes." Version B: "Your neighborhood's giving platform. Every dollar and every ad view funds real community projects." Version C: "Where communities fund what matters." Drive $200-400 in paid traffic to each. |
| Measure | Email signup conversion rate per variant. Target: 5%+ on the best variant. |
| Pass | At least one variant converts above 5%. Qualitative feedback shows understanding and interest. |
| Fail | All variants below 3%. People don't understand the concept or don't find it compelling. |
| If it fails | The community giving framing needs work. Consider: emphasizing specific project types (education, environment), leading with the zero-dollar pathway, or targeting a more specific community (neighborhood-level rather than broad). |

**Test 2: Willingness to Pay**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Will the target audience pay $3-12/month for a giving platform? |
| Method | Add a pricing page to the landing page. Show the tier structure (Free/$3/$5/$12). Measure how many email signups click through to a pricing page and which tier they select (no actual payment -- just intent). Follow up with a 5-question survey: "Would you pay $X/month for this?" with price sensitivity options. |
| Measure | % of signups who view pricing. Distribution of tier interest. Survey responses on price sensitivity. |
| Pass | 30%+ of signups view pricing. 10%+ indicate willingness to pay at $3+/month. |
| Fail | Fewer than 15% view pricing. Survey shows strong expectation of free (like other community platforms). |
| If it fails | Subscription model may not work at $3. Consider: lower entry tier ($1/month), freemium with more aggressive ad monetization, or transaction-based pricing instead of subscriptions. |

**Test 3: Ad-Funded Giving Concept**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Is "watch ads to fund community projects" compelling enough to drive daily behavior? |
| Method | Landing page variant that leads with the zero-dollar pathway: "Fund real projects in your community. No money required. Just your attention." Measure signup conversion separately from the concept-focused variants. Post-signup survey: "How often would you watch ads to fund a community project?" (Daily / A few times a week / Rarely / Never). |
| Measure | Signup conversion rate. Survey distribution of intended frequency. |
| Pass | Conversion rate comparable to concept-focused variants. 40%+ say "daily" or "a few times a week." |
| Fail | Conversion rate significantly lower than concept-focused variants. Majority say "rarely" or "never." |
| If it fails | Ad-funded giving is a supplementary feature, not a primary draw. Reduce emphasis on the zero-dollar pathway in marketing. The platform still works without it -- ad revenue is secondary. |

#### Wave 2: Engagement Mechanics (Weeks 3-6, ~$500-1,000)

These test whether the specific participation mechanisms will sustain engagement beyond initial signup.

**Test 4: Community Grant Interest (Two-Sided)**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Will people both propose community projects AND volunteer to complete them? |
| Method | Post in 3-5 local community groups (Facebook, Nextdoor, Reddit neighborhood subs). Describe the concept: "An app where neighbors can post small projects (yard cleanup, mural painting, lending library building) and other neighbors can volunteer. Volunteers earn credit toward funding other community projects." Two surveys: one for potential proposers ("Would you post a project?"), one for potential volunteers ("Would you pick up a project?"). |
| Measure | Response rate. Ratio of proposers to volunteers. Types of projects people describe. Willingness to do GPS-verified photo evidence. |
| Pass | Both proposer and volunteer interest exist in the same communities. At least 20% of respondents express interest in volunteering. People suggest realistic, completable project ideas. |
| Fail | Strong interest on one side but not the other (lots of proposers, no volunteers -- or vice versa). Projects suggested are too large/complex for the community grant model. |
| If it fails | If volunteer interest is low: consider paid gig-style compensation instead of watershed credits. If proposer interest is low: seed projects through nonprofit partnerships instead of relying on community proposals. If project scope is wrong: tighten the grant format to micro-projects only (2-4 hours, 1-2 people). |

**Test 5: Local Business Card Concept**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Will local businesses list themselves? Will users browse a community business directory? |
| Method | Approach 10-15 local businesses in one neighborhood. Pitch: "Free listing in a community app. Your neighbors see your card, and every view funds a local project. You get exposure and community impact credit." Track sign-up rate. Separately, show the browsing concept to 20-30 potential users: "Browse local businesses in your neighborhood. Every card you view funds a community project." Track stated interest in browsing. |
| Measure | Business listing conversion rate (% who agree to list). User interest in browsing (stated frequency). |
| Pass | 50%+ of approached businesses agree to a free listing. 30%+ of potential users say they'd browse at least weekly. |
| Fail | Businesses aren't interested or don't understand the value. Users don't see a reason to browse (already use Google/Yelp). |
| If it fails | If businesses won't list: consider seeding the directory from public data (Google Places) with an opt-in upgrade to claimed listings. If users won't browse: make business cards a passive background element in other flows rather than a standalone browsing experience. |

**Test 6: Referral Willingness**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Will people refer friends for watershed credits, or does it feel too transactional? |
| Method | In the post-signup survey from Wave 1, add: "If you could earn $2.50 in community impact credit for each friend who joins and stays active, would you share the app with friends?" Options: "Yes, I'd share with several people" / "Maybe 1-2 people" / "No, I don't like referral programs" / "I'd share it anyway, credits or not." |
| Measure | Distribution across options. Ratio of "would share anyway" to "only for credits." |
| Pass | 50%+ say they'd share with at least 1-2 people. A meaningful portion (20%+) say they'd share regardless of credits. |
| Fail | Majority say they don't like referral programs. Credits feel like a bribe rather than a bonus. |
| If it fails | The referral program still works mechanically, but marketing should emphasize community-building ("bring your friends into the movement") rather than credit incentives. Reduce the credit amount and increase the emotional framing. |

#### Wave 3: Market Feasibility (Weeks 5-8, ~$500-1,500)

These test whether the business can actually operate.

**Test 7: Ad Network Viability**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Can Deluge achieve $8-15 eCPM with impact-focused ad inventory? |
| Method | Research ad network options (Google AdMob, Unity Ads, AppLovin, ironSource). Contact 2-3 networks about expected eCPM for: 30-second rewarded video, community/social impact app audience, US market. Compare with published eCPM benchmarks for rewarded video in similar categories. |
| Measure | Estimated eCPM range from network conversations. Comparison with the $8-15 range assumed in projections. |
| Pass | At least one network confirms $8+ eCPM is realistic for rewarded video in a social impact app. |
| Fail | All networks estimate below $8 eCPM. Impact/social good inventory is undervalued by advertisers. |
| If it fails | Reduce ad revenue projections by 30-50%. The platform still works -- ad revenue is secondary to subscriptions -- but the free-tier value proposition weakens. Consider supplementing with direct-sold sponsorship ads from mission-aligned brands (higher eCPM but requires sales effort). |

**Test 8: Corporate Matching Interest**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Will corporate ESG teams pay for an ad-matching product? |
| Method | Draft a 1-page pitch for the "Impact Matching Fund" product. Approach 5-10 companies with ESG programs (start with local companies, B Corps, companies with visible CSR pages). Pitch: "Your brand matches the impact of community ad views. $25K fund, 5x match, your logo on every matched project. Full impact reporting." |
| Measure | Meeting conversion rate. Level of interest (polite decline vs. genuine interest vs. "send me a proposal"). |
| Pass | At least 2 companies request a follow-up meeting or proposal. |
| Fail | Universal polite decline. ESG teams don't understand the product or don't have budget authority for this type of spend. |
| If it fails | Corporate matching is Year 2+ revenue anyway. Delay the product until the platform has traction data to show. Focus initial corporate outreach on simpler products (employee giving programs, white-label impact pages) and introduce matching funds once there's proven ad engagement data to sell against. |

### Phase 0 Decision Framework

After all tests are complete, score the results:

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Tests 1-3 all pass | Core concept validated. Proceed to Phase 1 (legal + partnerships). |
| Test 1 fails | Fundamental concept question. Pivot the giving model framing or reconsider the approach. |
| Test 2 fails | Subscription model needs rethinking. May still proceed with adjusted revenue model. |
| Test 3 fails | Ad-funded pathway is supplementary, not primary. Proceed but reduce ad revenue projections. |
| Tests 4-6 mixed results | Engagement mechanics need adjustment but aren't fatal. Proceed with modifications. |
| Tests 7-8 fail | Operational feasibility problem. eCPM too low or corporate matching not viable. Adjust revenue projections and consider direct-sold sponsorship ads. |
| Test 8 fails | Defer corporate matching to Year 2+. Not a launch dependency. |

**The kill criteria:** If Test 1 (concept resonance) and Test 2 (willingness to pay) both fail, the core product concept does not have market demand as designed. Stop and rethink before spending $100K+ on engineering.

### Phase 0 Budget

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Landing page (Carrd, Webflow, or similar) | $0-50 |
| Paid traffic for A/B tests (Facebook/Instagram) | $600-1,200 |
| Survey tool (Typeform, Google Forms) | $0-35/month |
| Domain + email | $20-50 |
| Local business outreach (printing, travel) | $50-100 |
| Contingency | $200-500 |
| **Total** | **$900-2,000** |

Phase 0 is deliberately cheap. The goal is to spend under $2,000 to learn whether $1M+ in subsequent investment is justified.
