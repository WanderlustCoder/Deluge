# Business Model

## Core Model: Community-Driven Giving

Deluge is a platform where communities fund what matters. Users contribute cash or attention (watching ads, browsing local businesses, referring friends), and those contributions flow to community-proposed projects. There is no investment component, no portfolio management, no brokerage. The platform does one thing: it makes community giving transparent, collective, and sustainable.

### Who Deluge Serves

The target user is the person who donates to every fundraiser in their feed and shares every campaign they see. The person who wants to help but doesn't know where their money goes after they give it. Deluge exists alongside other giving options, offering transparency and collective impact as an alternative approach to the fragmented, opaque world of informal community giving.

### How It Works

1. **Users contribute** -- cash ($0.25 minimum), or attention (ads, business cards, referrals)
2. **Contributions flow to the watershed** -- each user's personal impact fund
3. **Users deploy from their watershed** -- to community projects (one-way grants) or microloans (recycling capital)
4. **Projects cascade** -- when fully funded, the project is executed, verified, and reported
5. **Microloans recycle** -- repayments return to the watershed, enabling the same dollar to fund multiple projects over time

### Why This Model Works

Deluge concentrates small contributions from many people into visible, verifiable outcomes. Every cent is tracked from source to project completion, so givers always see what their generosity built. One person watching all 30 daily ads earns roughly $0.27 for their watershed -- enough to fund a project on day one. 10,000 people doing the same thing contribute $985,500/year -- from attention alone.

This is the raindrop-to-river thesis: individual contributions are small, but collective and persistent giving creates measurable community impact. The platform's job is to make the collective visible and to make giving easy enough that people do it daily, not just when a fundraiser shows up in their feed.

### What Deluge Does Not Do

- **No investment accounts.** Deluge does not manage, invest, or custody user funds for wealth-building purposes.
- **No securities.** Deluge is not a broker-dealer, investment advisor, or securities platform.
- **No portfolio management.** There are no stocks, bonds, ETFs, or investment products.
- **No enforced savings mechanisms.** If users want to invest in their own financial future, Deluge encourages it through education and messaging -- but doesn't build the infrastructure.

This simplification is deliberate. The giving side -- communities, projects, cascades, microloans, the watershed -- is what makes Deluge different. Investment infrastructure is commodity that any funded startup can replicate. Removing it lets the team focus entirely on what makes the platform unique: making community giving work.

## Fee Structure: Free for Individuals, Revenue from B2B

No subscription fees. No per-transaction fees. Every dollar a user contributes goes to their watershed or directly to projects. Deluge is free for all individual users — always.

Revenue comes from the entities that benefit from Deluge's engaged community: businesses that want local visibility, corporations that want ESG impact, and the platform's own ad and lending operations.

### Revenue Sources

| Source | Description | Pricing |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Video ad revenue** | Platform keeps 40% of ad revenue; 60% goes to user's watershed. Ad values vary by advertiser, market, and format. Users can watch up to 30 ads/day, enough to reach the $0.25 minimum funding threshold on day one. | ~$0.008-0.025 per view (eCPM-dependent); 30/day cap |
| **Business directory (enhanced listings)** | Free basic listing for all businesses. Paid tier adds featured placement, analytics dashboard, photo gallery, project sponsorship badge | Free basic / $15-25/month enhanced |
| **Corporate campaign management** | Management fee for running matching fund campaigns (setup, branding, impact reporting, distribution) | 10-15% of matching fund commitment |
| **Microloan servicing fees** | 2% of each scheduled loan repayment, locked at origination | 2% per payment |
| **Cascade sponsorship** | Businesses or corporations co-brand the cascade celebration when a project hits 100% funding | $100-500 per cascade |
| **Notification sponsorship** | Hyperlocal business placement in high-engagement push notifications (e.g., "90% funded — 3 blocks from Joe's Coffee") | Priced per-market, per-notification tier |
| **Institutional partnerships** | White-label platform for cities/universities, aggregate impact data for foundations, financial institution partnerships for microloan borrowers | $10-50K/year per partnership |
| **Custodial float income** | Interest earned on aggregate watershed balances held in FDIC-insured accounts, money market funds, or short-term Treasuries. User principal is always protected and available. | Market rate (~4-5% at current rates) |

### Custodial Float Income

Every dollar in a user's watershed sits in Deluge's custody until the user deploys it to a project or loan. While those funds are idle, Deluge holds the aggregate balance in safe, liquid instruments (FDIC-insured bank sweep accounts, money market funds, or short-term U.S. Treasuries) and earns interest on the pool.

**How it works:**
- User deposits $25 into their watershed. The $25 is always theirs -- available to deploy or withdraw at any time.
- Deluge pools all watershed balances into custodial accounts that earn interest.
- Interest belongs to Deluge (the custodian), not the user. This is standard practice -- PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, and Stripe all earn float on customer funds the same way.
- User principal is never at risk. Funds are held in FDIC-insured instruments with sweep arrangements across multiple banks to stay within coverage limits.

**Revenue scales automatically with user growth:**

| Aggregate Pool | Annual Interest (4.5%) | Annual Interest (2%) | Annual Interest (0.5%) |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| $160K (Year 1) | $7K | $3.2K | $800 |
| $2.6M (Year 3) | $118K | $52K | $13K |
| $11.25M (Year 5) | $506K | $225K | $56K |

**The transparency commitment:** Deluge discloses custodial float income prominently -- on the platform dashboard, in the annual transparency report, and in plain language: *"Your watershed balance funds projects when you deploy it, and keeps the platform free while it sits. Every dollar works twice."*

**Interest rate risk:** At current rates (~4.5%), this is a meaningful stream. In a low-rate environment (0.1-0.5%), it's nearly zero. Model conservatively and treat high-rate periods as upside.

### Business Directory Economics

The business directory is designed to be a significant revenue engine, not a minor feature:

| Listing Tier | Monthly Fee | Features |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Basic** | Free | Name, category, description (50 words), one photo, location pin, standard browse placement |
| **Enhanced** | $15-25/month | Everything in Basic + featured placement in browse feeds, analytics dashboard (views, saves, recommendations), photo gallery, ability to publicly sponsor a project ("Views of our card fund the Elm Street playground"), "Deluge Community Partner" badge for storefront/website |

At 200 businesses across initial markets paying $20/month average: $48K/year. At 2,000 businesses: $480K/year. Business directory revenue scales with geographic expansion and is stickier than ad revenue.

### Ad-Funded Impact

Users can watch video ads to grow their watershed balance. Ad revenue enters the watershed like any other contribution -- the user decides how to deploy it (grants, loans, or hold). This gives every user a way to build impact capital, even with $0 in cash.

**"Can't give money? Donate your attention instead."**

**How it works:**
1. User watches a 30-second video ad
2. Advertiser pays Deluge (platform earns ad revenue)
3. Deluge keeps 40% for platform operations
4. Remaining 60% is credited to the user's watershed

**Economics per ad view (conservative):**

| Metric | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Advertiser pays Deluge (eCPM) | $8 CPM ($0.008/view) | $15 CPM ($0.015/view) | $25 CPM ($0.025/view) |
| Deluge keeps (platform margin) | 40% ($0.0032) | 40% ($0.006) | 40% ($0.01) |
| Credited to watershed | 60% ($0.0048) | 60% ($0.009) | 60% ($0.015) |

**Transparency note:** Deluge must clearly disclose how the ad revenue is split. "$0.009 from this ad was added to your watershed. Deluge kept $0.006 to run the platform." This is the opposite of exploitative models that obscure their economics.

**Caps and controls:**

| Control | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Daily cap | 10 ads per user per day |
| Monthly max to watershed (base) | ~$2.70/month (10 ads/day x 30 days x $0.009) |
| Anti-fraud | CAPTCHA, pattern detection, device fingerprinting, account verification |

**What this means per user (watershed growth from ads):**

| Usage Pattern | Monthly to Watershed | Annual to Watershed |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Casual (2 ads/day) | $0.54 | $6.48 |
| Regular (5 ads/day) | $1.35 | $16.20 |
| Max (10 ads/day) | $2.70 | $32.40 |

**What this means collectively (the real story):**

| Users Watching Ads | Avg Views/Day | Monthly to Watersheds | Annual to Watersheds |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1,000 | 3 | $810 | $9,720 |
| 10,000 | 3 | $8,100 | $97,200 |
| 50,000 | 3 | $40,500 | $486,000 |

These are small numbers per person. The value is in the collective: 10,000 users watching 3 ads a day adds nearly $100K to watersheds annually -- deployable to grants or loans, from attention alone, no cash required. This is the raindrop-to-river effect applied to advertising revenue.

**The $0.25 connection:** The platform's universal unit of participation is $0.25 -- one microloan share, one meaningful grant or loan contribution. At base ad rates ($0.009/view to watershed), a user watching 5 ads per day reaches $0.25 in about 6 days. Under 5 minutes a day of attention, and you can fund a loan share or contribute to a project in under a week. No money required. Combined with business card browsing (~$0.0012/view to watershed), that timeline shrinks further: 3 video ads + 30 business card views daily (~3 minutes) reaches $0.25 in about 4 days. This means the person working two jobs with nothing left over can still participate in the same projects and loans as cash contributors. The contribution source differs, but the participation is equal -- the school being built doesn't distinguish, and neither does the bakery loan.

**What this means for Deluge (platform revenue from ads):**

| Users Watching Ads | Avg Views/Day | Daily Ad Revenue (Deluge's 40%) | Annual |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| 1,000 | 3 | $18 | $6,570 |
| 10,000 | 3 | $180 | $65,700 |
| 50,000 | 3 | $900 | $328,500 |

Ad revenue is the largest single platform revenue stream. It scales linearly with active users and daily ad engagement.

**Why ad revenue flows through the watershed:** Ad revenue enters the user's watershed like any other contribution. The user decides where to deploy it -- a grant project, a microloan, or hold it for later. This makes ad-watching a true pathway to full platform participation: a user with no cash can build watershed capital through attention and fund a microloan share just like a cash contributor. The watershed is the universal funnel. Money is money once it's there, regardless of whether it came from cash, ads, or referrals.

### Local Business Directory (Community Business Cards)

Alongside video ads, Deluge offers a local business directory where browsing funds community projects. Small businesses create simple digital "business cards" -- name, services, location, photo, short description -- instead of producing video ads. Users browse cards like a local business directory, and each view generates a small contribution to projects.

**"Discover local businesses. Every view funds your community."**

**Why this exists alongside video ads:**

Video ads require production budgets that local businesses don't have. A neighborhood coffee shop, a local plumber, a community bookstore -- they can create a card in 10 minutes on their phone but can't produce a 30-second video ad. The business card format removes the production barrier entirely while creating a new surface for community funding.

**How it works:**

1. Local business creates a listing: business name, category, location, one photo, 50-word description
2. Users browse business cards by category or proximity (within the Give tab or a dedicated Local section)
3. Each view generates a small contribution to the user's chosen project
4. Users can save businesses they're interested in, leave recommendations
5. Businesses see a dashboard: views, saves, and community impact generated by their listing

**Economics per view:**

| Metric | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Revenue per card view | $0.001 | $0.002 | $0.003 |
| Deluge keeps (40%) | $0.0004 | $0.0008 | $0.0012 |
| Credited to project (60%) | $0.0006 | $0.0012 | $0.0018 |

Per-view value is significantly lower than video ads, but volume is much higher. A user can flip through 50 cards in a minute versus watching one 30-second video.

**Per-user impact from card browsing:**

| Usage Pattern | Views/Day | Monthly to Projects (base) |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Casual (10 cards/day) | 10 | $0.36 |
| Regular (30 cards/day) | 30 | $1.08 |
| Active (50 cards/day) | 50 | $1.80 |

Combined with video ads (5/day = $1.35/month), an active browser generates $3.15/month to projects from attention alone.

**What this means collectively:**

| Active Browsers | Avg Views/Day | Monthly to Projects | Annual to Projects |
|----------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1,000 | 20 | $720 | $8,640 |
| 10,000 | 20 | $7,200 | $86,400 |
| 50,000 | 20 | $36,000 | $432,000 |

**Business model for listings:**

| Model | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Free listings | Basic listing is free -- removes all barriers for small businesses |
| Enhanced listings | Featured placement, analytics dashboard, photo gallery, project sponsorship badge ($15-25/month) |
| Sponsored projects | Businesses can link their listing to a specific project: "Views of our listing fund Lincoln Elementary's garden" |

**Value to the business:**

- Exposure to a self-selected audience of community-minded people (exactly who local businesses want to reach)
- Community impact badge: "Supporting local projects through Deluge" for their storefront window
- Dashboard showing their listing's contribution: "Your listing has contributed $47 to local projects this month"
- Association with community values without a large ad budget

**Why users browse instead of using Yelp:**

Browsing on Yelp benefits Yelp. Browsing on Deluge funds your neighborhood. For the target user -- the community-oriented person who wants to support local -- that's a meaningful difference. The directory also filters for values-aligned businesses: a business that lists on Deluge is signaling community commitment.

**Content quality:**

Local business cards don't require production quality. A photo of the storefront, a brief description of services, and location information is sufficient. The format is closer to a community bulletin board than a glossy ad platform. This is deliberate -- it matches the community-driven, authentic tone of the platform.

**Geographic scaling:**

Local business cards require enough users and businesses in a geography to be useful. This is a market-by-market feature:
- Launch in initial markets where Deluge has user density
- Expand to new markets as user base grows
- In markets without local business listings, the Give tab focuses on video ads

## Free-Tier Participation Pathways

Ad-funded impact gives every user a way to contribute, but at $2.70/month (10 ads/day, base scenario), it takes over 7 months for a user to accumulate enough watershed capital to fund a single microloan contribution. That's too slow. A user who can't contribute cash needs a realistic on-ramp to meaningful participation within their first month or two.

Two additional mechanisms address this: referral credits and corporate ad matching. Each uses a different funding source and serves a different role in the user experience.

### Referral Credits

Users earn watershed capital when they refer new users who become active on the platform. Every successful referral saves $10-20 versus paid advertising, so funding referral credits from the marketing budget is ROI-positive.

**Vesting model:**

Credits vest in stages tied to the referred user's real engagement, not just signup. This protects against fake accounts, self-referral, and collusion rings.

| Milestone | Credit to Referrer | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Friend signs up + verifies identity | $0.50 | Baseline -- real person confirmed |
| Friend completes first action (first cash contribution or first 5 ads watched) | $1.00 | Genuine engagement, not a throwaway |
| Friend is active at Day 30 (logged in 5+ times, any activity) | $1.00 | Retained user -- the referral stuck |
| **Total per referral (ad-only referred user)** | **$2.50** | |

If the referred user makes a cash contribution of $5 or more, the "first action" milestone pays $1.50 instead of $1.00, bringing the total to $3.00 per referral.

**Rate limits:**

| Control | Limit | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Monthly referral cap | 10 referrals | Prevents industrial-scale farming |
| Lifetime referral cap | 50 referrals | Diminishing returns; 50 referrals is enormous growth contribution |
| Credit destination | Watershed only | No cash extraction -- credits fund projects or loans only |
| Referral link expiry | 7 days of inactivity | Referred user must take a meaningful action within 7 days |

**Anti-fraud requirements for the referred user:**

- Unique phone number (SMS verification)
- Unique device (fingerprint)
- Cannot share a bank account with the referrer
- Activity thresholds must be met organically (no automated ad-watching, no instant-abandon patterns)

**Fraud vectors and mitigations:**

| Attack | How It Works | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Self-referral | User creates multiple accounts, refers themselves | Device fingerprinting, phone number uniqueness, bank account uniqueness |
| Account farming | Creates 50 fake accounts to refer to one real account | Activity thresholds before credit releases -- real engagement required |
| Collusion rings | Groups sign up for each other, extract credits, go dormant | Credit doesn't fully vest until Day 30 with real activity |
| Bought referrals | Pays strangers to sign up using their link | Activity thresholds filter out mercenary signups who never engage |

**Economics:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cost per referral to Deluge | $2.50-3.00 (watershed credit) |
| Cost per paid acquisition (current) | $15-25 |
| Net savings per referral vs. paid | $12-22 |
| Monthly budget at 1,000 referrals/month | $2,500-3,000 |

Referral credits are front-loaded and exhaustible -- a user's referral network saturates after a few months. Expected per-user referral earnings: $5-15 in the first 2-3 months, tapering to near-zero after 6 months. This is an onboarding boost, not a long-term earning mechanism.

**Funding source:** Marketing budget. Referral credits directly offset paid acquisition costs.

---

### Corporate Ad Matching

Corporate partners multiply the value of ad-funded contributions by committing matching funds. When users watch ads for projects in a matched category, the per-ad contribution is amplified. This is the simplest mechanism to dramatically increase free-tier user earning power.

**How it works:**

1. A corporate partner commits a matching fund (e.g., $10,000-50,000)
2. The partner specifies matching criteria: all projects, specific categories (education, environment), specific regions, or specific projects
3. When users watch ads for matched projects, the corporate fund adds to the per-ad contribution
4. The match comes from the corporate fund, not from Deluge's cut -- Deluge still keeps 40% of base ad revenue

**Match levels:**

| Match Level | Per-Ad to Project | Monthly (10 ads/day) | Corporate Cost Per Ad |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| No match (current) | $0.009 | $2.70 | $0 |
| 2x match | $0.018 | $5.40 | $0.009 |
| 3x match | $0.027 | $8.10 | $0.018 |
| 5x match | $0.045 | $13.50 | $0.036 |
| 10x match (campaign events) | $0.090 | $27.00 | $0.081 |

At a 5x match, a free-tier user maxing daily ads earns $13.50/month toward projects. At 10x (limited campaigns), $27/month -- enough to fund a microloan contribution in the first month.

**Corporate partner value proposition:**

- Employee engagement: "Your team watches ads, your brand matches the impact"
- Brand visibility: corporate logo on matched project pages, visible in the crediting animation
- ESG reporting: verified impact metrics tied to the corporate matching fund
- Cost efficiency: $25K matching fund at 5x for 500 active ad-watchers lasts ~3.7 months -- comparable to a small corporate community program budget

**Match fund duration and communication:**

Matching campaigns have defined budgets and timeframes. Users are clearly informed: "This project has a 5x match from [Company] -- limited time" or "Match fund: $4,200 remaining." When a match fund is exhausted, contributions return to base rates with clear notification. No false expectation that matching is permanent.

**Economics:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deluge revenue impact | None -- matching doesn't reduce Deluge's 40% cut |
| Average corporate match commitment (est.) | $10K-50K per campaign |
| Match duration at $25K / 5x / 500 users | ~3.7 months |
| New B2B SKU | "Impact Matching Fund" added to corporate ESG product line |

**Funding source:** Corporate ESG budgets. This is a new product in the existing B2B revenue pipeline alongside white-label solutions.

---

### Combined Free-Tier On-Ramp

With all three mechanisms plus existing ad revenue, a free-tier user's realistic first-month earning potential:

| Mechanism | Monthly Estimate | Availability |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Ads (5/day average) | $1.35 | Daily, passive |
| Referral credits (2-3 friends in first month) | $5.00-7.50 | Front-loaded, first 2-3 months |
| Corporate match on ads (3x average when active) | $2.70 | Campaign-dependent |
| **Combined first-month estimate** | **$9-12** | |

A free-tier user can realistically fund a microloan contribution within their first month. The on-ramp works.

**Long-term earning (after referral exhaustion):**

| Mechanism | Monthly Estimate | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Ads (5/day) | $1.35 | Ongoing baseline |
| Corporate match (when active) | $1.35-4.05 | Campaigns come and go |
| **Sustained monthly estimate** | **$3-5** | |

Even after referral credits dry up, the combination of ads and corporate matching keeps free-tier users at a meaningful earning level. Corporate matching is the key amplifier because it multiplies the value of attention-based contributions.

---

## All Revenue Streams

### Primary: Ad Revenue

Video ads are the largest single revenue stream. Users watch 15-30 second ads to fund their chosen project. Deluge keeps 40% ($0.003-0.010 per view); 60% goes directly to the project ($0.005-0.015 per view).

Ad revenue scales linearly with active users and daily ad engagement. At 5 ads/day average among active ad-watchers (50% of MAU):

| Users | Active Ad-Watchers (50%) | Weekly to Deluge (40%) | Annual to Deluge |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 10,000 | 5,000 | ~$830 | ~$43K |
| 50,000 | 25,000 | ~$4,150 | ~$216K |
| 100,000 | 50,000 | ~$8,300 | ~$432K |
| 500,000 | 250,000 | ~$41,500 | ~$2.16M |

**Key risks:** eCPM fluctuation (ad rates vary by season, market conditions, and advertiser demand), user engagement drop-off (if daily ad-watching habit doesn't form), and ad network policy changes.

### Primary: Business Directory

Enhanced business listings provide predictable, recurring monthly revenue tied to geographic expansion rather than individual user behavior.

Revenue scales with number of markets and business density per market. Target: 50+ businesses per active market, 20-30% conversion to enhanced listings.

| Markets | Businesses | Enhanced (25%) | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 3 | 150 | 38 | $760 | ~$9K |
| 10 | 500 | 125 | $2,500 | ~$30K |
| 25 | 1,250 | 313 | $6,250 | ~$75K |
| 50 | 2,500 | 625 | $12,500 | ~$150K |
| 100 | 5,000 | 1,250 | $25,000 | ~$300K |

### Secondary: Attention-Funded Revenue (Business Card Browsing)

In addition to video ads, business card browsing generates project funding at ~$0.0008/view to Deluge (base). Lower per-view than video ads but higher volume per session. Business card browsing revenue is supplementary and grows as the directory expands to more markets.

### Year 2+: B2B Revenue

- Corporate campaign management: management fees (10-15%) for running matching fund campaigns ($10K-50K per campaign)
- Corporate Impact Matching Funds: corporate partners commit matching funds that amplify ad-funded contributions for matched projects. See "Corporate Ad Matching" under Free-Tier Participation Pathways for full economics.
- Cascade/notification sponsorship: businesses co-brand cascade celebrations and hyperlocal push notifications
- Institutional partnerships: white-label platform for cities/universities, aggregate impact data for foundations ($10-50K/year per partnership)
- Realistic Year 2 target: 2-3 clients, not 5-10
- Institutional partnerships take time to develop -- don't count on them early

### Year 2+: Microloan Servicing Fees

- 2% servicing fee on each scheduled loan payment, locked at origination
- Not a primary revenue driver -- estimated $120/month at 100 active loans
- Scales modestly with loan volume: 1,000 active loans at $500 avg could generate ~$1,200/month
- The real value of microloans is mission alignment, user engagement, and recycled impact capital -- not platform revenue

### Year 3+: Credit Bureau Reporting (Cost Center, Not Revenue)

- Credit bureau reporting costs ~$75-120K to implement over Years 2-4
- Ongoing compliance costs ~$5-10K/year
- Does not generate direct revenue, but improves repayment rates by an estimated 5-10%
- Recovered capital from improved repayment recycles through the watershed, increasing cumulative impact
- See "Credit Bureau Reporting (Roadmap)" in the Microloans section for full breakdown

### Long-Term (Speculative)

| Stream | Description | When Realistic |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Success fees | Small % when projects hit milestones | Year 2+ |
| Equity upside | Small stake in innovation startups | Year 4+ (if ever) |

Do not build financial models that depend on speculative revenue.

## Contribution Breakdown

There are two types of contributions on Deluge: cash contributions and attention-funded contributions.

### Cash Contribution ($10 example)

| Destination | Amount | What Happens |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| User's Watershed | $10.00 (100%) | Enters the user's personal impact fund. User deploys to projects or microloans. |

No fees deducted from cash contributions. Minimum contribution: $0.25. Platform costs are covered by B2B revenue streams (business directory, corporate partnerships) and ad revenue — never by individual user fees.

### Attention-Funded Contribution (1 ad view, base scenario)

| Allocation | Amount | What Happens |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Deluge (platform) | $0.006 (40%) | Covers ad infrastructure, fraud prevention, platform costs |
| User's Watershed | $0.009 (60%) | Enters the user's personal impact fund. User deploys to projects or microloans. |

*Advertiser paid $0.015. Deluge kept $0.006. The remaining $0.009 entered the user's watershed.*

Attention-funded contributions (video ads and business card browsing) flow into the user's watershed, just like cash. The user decides how to deploy: fund a grant project, back a microloan, or hold. This makes ad-watching a full pathway to platform participation -- including loan funding.

---

## Microloans & The Watershed

### The Watershed (User Impact Fund)

Every user has a personal watershed -- a fund balance representing their deployable impact capital. The watershed is the central mechanism through which impact dollars flow.

**Money flows in:**

| Source | How |
|--------|-----|
| Cash contributions | 100% of every cash contribution enters the watershed ($0.25 minimum) |
| Ad revenue | 60% of each ad view credited to the user's watershed ($0.009 at base) |
| Business card browsing | Revenue from card views credited to the user's watershed |
| Referral credits | Vesting watershed credits earned by referring new active users (funded from marketing budget) |
| Loan repayments | When a microloan borrower makes a payment, principal returns to funders' watersheds via share-based repayment |

*Every contribution pathway feeds the same watershed. The user decides how to deploy: grants, loans, or hold.*

**Money flows out:**

| Destination | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| Grant projects | One-way deployment. Money funds a project and does not return. |
| Microloans | Circular deployment. Funds a borrower. If repaid, principal returns to the watershed. If not, the money is lost (disclosed risk). |

The watershed enables capital recycling. A single dollar of impact capital can fund multiple loans over time if borrowers repay. This is the key economic advantage of microloans over grants: one dollar of impact does work, returns, and does work again.

**$0.25 as the universal unit of participation:** Whether someone contributes cash, watches ads, or earns referral credits -- every pathway feeds the same watershed, and $0.25 is the minimum meaningful unit. An ad-watcher builds $0.25 in watershed capital within a week of casual attention. That $0.25 can fund a grant project or a microloan share -- the user decides. The entry ticket to full platform participation is the same regardless of pathway. At scale, 2,000 ad-watchers each building $0.25/week in their watersheds generate $500/week in deployable impact capital -- $26,000/year from people who gave zero dollars, flowing into both projects and loans.

### Microloan Economics

**Loan structure:**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Loan amounts | $100 (Tier 1) up to $5,000 (Tier 5), based on borrower's credit progression |
| Repayment period | Set by borrower at application within tier limits: T1=6mo, T2=12mo, T3=18mo, T4-5=24mo max |
| Servicing fee | 2% of each scheduled payment, locked at origination, never changes |
| Interest rate | 0% -- there is no interest on microloans, only the servicing fee |
| Share price | $0.25 per share (fixed, universal) |
| Minimum contribution | $0.25 (one share). Fund any amount in $0.25 increments. |
| Shares per loan | Loan amount / $0.25 (e.g., $500 loan = 2,000 shares) |

**Share-based interleaved FIFO disbursement model:**

Every contribution is broken into $0.25 shares. Shares are interleaved round-robin across the repayment queue, with each funder's position within each round determined by their funding time (earliest funder first). The core rule: **no funder receives share N+1 until all active funders have received share N.** This ensures proportional repayment at all times.

Each payment repays the next batch of shares in queue order, distributing small amounts across all active funders. Smaller funders finish first (fewer shares, exit rotation sooner). Larger funders stay in the loan longer. Your money comes back a little at a time -- and that's a feature, not a limitation. It means default risk is proportional (all funders at roughly the same percentage repaid at any point) and smaller contributions finish faster.

Example: $500 loan, $60 monthly payment, 3 funders (among others):

- Funder A (day 1): $50 = 200 shares
- Funder B (day 2): $20 = 80 shares
- Funder C (day 3): $5 = 20 shares
- Other funders: $425 = 1,700 shares
- Total: 2,000 shares

Round-robin interleave order: A, B, C, [others...], A, B, C, [others...], ...

Each $60 payment repays 240 shares. With all funders in rotation, each funder receives repayment proportional to their share of the loan per cycle.

| Payment # | Shares Repaid | A receives | B receives | C receives | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | 240 | ~$6.00 (24 shares) | ~$2.50 (10 shares) | ~$0.50 (2 shares) | All funders active |
| 2 | 240 | ~$6.00 | ~$2.50 | ~$0.50 | C nearing completion |
| ~3 | 240 | ~$6.00 | ~$2.50 | -- | C fully repaid, exits rotation |
| ~5 | 240 | ~$6.50 | -- | -- | B fully repaid, exits rotation |
| ... | 240 | ~$6.75+ | -- | -- | A stays through end of loan |

C (smallest funder) finishes first. A (largest funder) stays through the end. At any point, all active funders have been repaid roughly the same fraction of their contribution.

**Servicing fee revenue:**

| Loan Size | Payment | Fee/Payment (2%) | Total Payments | Total Fee Revenue |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| $100 | $25 | $0.50 | 4 | $2.00 |
| $200 | $40 | $0.80 | 5 | $4.00 |
| $500 | $60 | $1.20 | ~9 | ~$10.80 |
| $1,000 | $100 | $2.00 | 10 | $20.00 |
| $2,000 | $150 | $3.00 | ~14 | ~$42.00 |
| $5,000 | $250 | $5.00 | 20 | $100.00 |

This is not a primary revenue stream. At 100 active loans averaging $500, Deluge collects roughly $120/month in servicing fees. The value of microloans is mission alignment and user engagement, not platform revenue.

**Overpayment incentive structure:**

The 2% servicing fee applies only to the scheduled payment amount. Overpayments above the scheduled amount are fee-free. This directly incentivizes faster repayment:

| Scenario ($500 loan, $60/payment) | Total Fees Paid | Savings |
|------------------------------------|----------------|---------|
| Standard repayment (9 payments) | $10.80 | -- |
| Doubles up every other month (~5 payments) | $6.00 | $4.80 |
| Pays $120/month consistently (~5 payments) | $6.00 | $4.80 |

Fewer payment events = fewer fees. The borrower is rewarded for paying faster, funders get their shares repaid sooner, and everyone benefits.

**Double payment handling:**

When a borrower makes two payments in one period, they choose:

- **Pay next month early** -- treated as a scheduled payment event, fee applies, advances the due date
- **Pay down principal** -- treated as an overpayment, fee-free, enters credit-forward

The choice is the borrower's. Sometimes breathing room matters more than saving on fees.

**Credit-forward mechanics:**

Credit-forward holds sub-$0.25 remainders when a payment doesn't divide evenly into shares. This is a near-trivial edge case under the share model since most payments divide cleanly into $0.25 shares.

- Credit-forward carries no additional fee (already fee-cleared)
- Combines with the next payment to fill additional shares
- Resolves fully at loan completion
- Visible to borrower: "Credit toward next share: $0.15"

**Refinancing:**

Refinancing allows a borrower to adjust their payment amount or extend their term. It is a borrower support tool, not a revenue driver.

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Minimum loan balance for refinancing | $1,000. Below this, loans are small enough that the original payment should be manageable. |
| Refinancing fee | 1% of remaining loan balance, or $10 minimum, whichever is greater |
| When available | Any time during an active loan, or during default to enable recovery |
| Purpose | Make payments affordable, avoid or recover from default |
| Effect on share queue | No change -- funders keep their shares and rotation positions |
| Effect on term limits | Refinancing can exceed the tier's original term cap. Term limits apply at origination, not post-refinance. |

**Why $1,000 minimum:** Loans below $1,000 have payments small enough that refinancing adds administrative overhead without meaningful benefit. A $500 loan at $60/month doesn't need refinancing -- the 3-payment recovery path ($180 total) or full payoff is the appropriate tool.

**Why $10 minimum fee:** At 1% of remaining balance, small loans generate sub-dollar fees that cost more to process than they're worth. The $10 minimum ensures refinancing covers its own administrative cost. For a $1,000 remaining balance, 1% = $10 (meets minimum). For a $2,000 remaining balance, 1% = $20 (exceeds minimum).

**When refinancing makes sense:**
- Borrower can't afford the original payment amount on a $1,000+ loan and wants to avoid default
- Borrower is in default on a $1,000+ loan and needs a lower payment to achieve the 3-consecutive-payment recovery threshold
- Borrower's circumstances changed (job loss, reduced income) and a temporary adjustment prevents a worse outcome

**Revenue impact:** At 1% of remaining balance with a $10 minimum, a $1,500 remaining balance generates a $15 refinancing fee. This is modest but covers the administrative cost of processing the refinance. Deluge should not depend on refinancing fees as a meaningful revenue stream -- the value is in keeping borrowers repaying rather than defaulting.

**Credit progression tiers:**

| Tier | Max Loan | Requirement |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | $100 | Verified Deluge account |
| 2 | $500 | 1 loan repaid in full, on time |
| 3 | $1,000 | 2 loans repaid, ≤1 late payment total |
| 4 | $2,000 | 3+ loans repaid, strong history |
| 5 | $5,000 | Established track record |

Progression is earned through repayment behavior, not dollar amounts borrowed.

**Default rates and risk:**

Microloan default rates vary widely depending on vetting and support systems. Kiva reports ~3% historical default. Without a partner network doing in-person vetting, Deluge should plan conservatively:

| Scenario | Default Rate | Impact on Funders |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Optimistic | 5% | 1 in 20 loans loses funder capital |
| Base | 10% | 1 in 10 loans loses funder capital |
| Conservative | 15% | ~1 in 7 loans loses funder capital |

At a 10% default rate with average $500 loans, a funder who backs 10 loans ($200 total) would expect to lose ~$20 to defaults and recover ~$180 to their watershed. The recovered $180 can be redeployed, so one cycle of $200 deployed does roughly $380 in total lending over two cycles. Impact capital multiplies despite defaults.

**Default recovery & credit rehabilitation economics:**

Default is not necessarily permanent. A borrower can exit default by making 3 consecutive on-time payments or paying off the remaining balance in full. On recovery, the borrower's credit is halved (rounded down to nearest $5, minimum $25).

**Impact on recycled capital:**
- A recovered default still caused delay and disruption -- funders waited longer for repayment, and some of their shares may have already been written off as losses
- But eventually, capital returns to the system: the borrower resumes payments, funders resume receiving disbursements, and the watershed refills
- The credit halving means the borrower's next loan is smaller, which reduces the amount at risk in their next cycle
- The $25 minimum floor means even worst-case borrowers (multiple defaults and recoveries) can still participate in the system with a loan amount large enough to fund something real -- nobody is permanently excluded

**Adjusted recycled capital with recovery scenarios (base, 10% default rate, 30% recovery rate among defaults):**

| Year | Defaults | Recovered Defaults | Capital Eventually Returned | Net Lost |
|------|----------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| 3 | $8,000 | $2,400 (30%) | ~$2,000 (partial -- recovery takes time) | ~$6,000 |
| 4 | $25,000 | $7,500 | ~$6,000 | ~$19,000 |
| 5 | $60,000 | $18,000 | ~$15,000 | ~$45,000 |

Recovery doesn't eliminate default losses, but it meaningfully reduces them. A 30% recovery rate among defaults improves the effective default rate from 10% to ~7%, which compounds favorably as recycled capital grows.

**Credit halving worked examples (economics perspective):**

| Borrower Scenario | Credit Before | Credit After Recovery | Next Loan Max | Risk Reduction |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Tier 3 borrower defaults | $1,000 | $500 | $500 | 50% less capital at risk |
| Tier 2 borrower defaults | $500 | $250 | $250 | 50% less capital at risk |
| Tier 1 borrower defaults | $100 | $50 | $50 | 50% less capital at risk |
| Repeated defaulter | $50 | $25 | $25 | At floor |
| Floor borrower | $25 | $25 | $25 | Minimum participation preserved |

**Recycled capital projections (base scenario):**

| Year | Active Loans | Avg Loan Size | Total Deployed | Repaid & Recycled | Cumulative Impact |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2 | 50 | $300 | $15,000 | $10,000 | $25,000 |
| 3 | 200 | $400 | $80,000 | $55,000 | $135,000 |
| 4 | 500 | $500 | $250,000 | $180,000 | $430,000 |
| 5 | 1,000 | $600 | $600,000 | $450,000 | $1,050,000 |

"Cumulative Impact" counts every dollar deployed, including recycled capital. One dollar flowing through two loan cycles counts as $2 of impact. This is the multiplier effect: grants deploy once, loans deploy repeatedly.

### Sponsorship (Community-Backed Credit Extension)

Sponsorship allows community members to vouch for a borrower, extending the borrower's credit limit beyond their earned tier. Sponsorship is a reputation-based system -- sponsors do not stake their own watershed funds, but their platform track record determines how much credit they can extend.

**How sponsorship power works:**

```
sponsorship_power = base_contributions × multiplier
```

- `base_contributions` = total dollars the sponsor has contributed to the platform (cash contributions + ad contributions)
- `multiplier` = track_record_ratio × (100% + volume_bonus), capped at 200%
- `track_record_ratio` = total_repaid_value / total_completed_value (portfolio-weighted across all sponsored loans)
- `volume_bonus` = grows with successful sponsorship history, up to +100%

A sponsor who has contributed $1,000 to the platform with a perfect track record and maximum volume bonus can extend up to $2,000 in credit (200% of base).

**Sponsorship power examples:**

| Sponsor Profile | Base Contributions | Track Record | Volume Bonus | Multiplier | Sponsorship Power |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| New sponsor (first 3 loans) | $500 | 100% (learning period) | 0% | 100% | $500 |
| Established, clean record | $1,000 | 100% | 30% | 130% | $1,300 |
| Veteran, one small default | $2,000 | 95% | 50% | 143% | $2,850 |
| Veteran, perfect record | $2,000 | 100% | 80% | 180% | $3,600 |
| Maximum power | $5,000 | 100% | 100% | 200% | $10,000 |

**Default impact on sponsors (portfolio-weighted):**

When a sponsored loan defaults, the sponsor's track record ratio decreases proportionally to the defaulted amount relative to their total completed sponsorship volume. This means a single small default against a large portfolio of successful sponsorships barely moves the needle.

| Scenario | Total Completed | Default Amount | Track Record Ratio | Impact |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| $100 default, $10,000 in successful sponsorships | $10,100 | $100 | 99% | Minimal |
| $500 default, $2,000 in successful sponsorships | $2,500 | $500 | 80% | Moderate |
| $500 default, $500 in successful sponsorships | $1,000 | $500 | 50% | Severe |

This is designed to feel fair, not punitive. A sponsor with a long track record of good judgment doesn't lose their reputation over one misjudgment.

**Recovery via aggregate counteraction:**

A sponsor can recover from defaults by successfully sponsoring new loans totaling 2x the defaulted amount (aggregate across any combination of loans). Once the counteraction threshold is met, the defaulted loan is marked as counteracted and stops dragging down the track record ratio.

Example: A sponsor has $500 in defaults. They need $1,000 in new successfully repaid sponsorships (any combination -- two $500 loans, five $200 loans, etc.) to fully counteract the damage.

**Sponsorship economics for the platform:**

Sponsorship itself generates no direct revenue. Its value is indirect:

| Indirect Benefit | How It Helps |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Larger loans enabled | Higher credit limits → larger loans → more servicing fee revenue per loan |
| Community engagement | Sponsors are deeply invested users who stay on the platform |
| Better repayment rates | Social accountability -- borrowers with sponsors have someone vouching for them |
| User retention | Both sponsors and borrowers have stronger reasons to remain active |

**Estimated impact on servicing fee revenue (base scenario):**

| Year | Loans Enabled by Sponsorship | Avg Sponsored Loan Size | Additional Servicing Fees |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 2 | 10 | $600 | ~$120 |
| 3 | 50 | $800 | ~$800 |
| 4 | 150 | $1,000 | ~$3,000 |
| 5 | 400 | $1,200 | ~$9,600 |

Sponsorship won't move the revenue needle in early years. By Year 5, sponsored loans could contribute meaningfully to servicing fee volume -- but the real value remains community engagement and mission alignment.

**Concurrent loan sponsorship economics:**

When sponsors enable a concurrent second loan, their sponsorship power is halved for that sponsorship. This reflects the higher risk of a borrower managing two loans simultaneously.

| Sponsor Profile | Full Power | Power for Concurrent Sponsorship | Effect |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------------|--------|
| New sponsor ($500 power) | $500 | $250 | Can cover less of a concurrent loan |
| Established ($1,300 power) | $1,300 | $650 | Requires larger sponsor commitment or multiple sponsors |
| Veteran ($3,600 power) | $3,600 | $1,800 | Still substantial, but naturally limited |
| Maximum ($10,000 power) | $10,000 | $5,000 | Even maximum sponsors extend less credit for concurrent loans |

**Sponsor-upward uses full power:** When a sponsor vouches to increase an existing active loan (same loan, same purpose, same borrower), sponsorship power applies at the full rate. The rationale: increasing a single loan is lower risk than enabling a second concurrent loan. The borrower is already managing one obligation; adding to it is simpler than splitting attention across two.

**Risk considerations:**

- Sponsored loans carry higher default risk than organically-earned tier loans (borrower hasn't proven repayment at that level)
- Conservative estimate: sponsored loan default rate 15-20% vs. 10% for tier-earned loans
- Concurrent loans carry the highest risk -- two obligations increase the chance of default on both
- Conservative estimate: concurrent loan default rate 20-25%
- Sponsor reputation system provides a natural check -- sponsors with bad track records lose sponsorship power
- Platform should monitor sponsored loan default rates separately (standard, upward, concurrent) and adjust if the gap widens
- Sponsor track record retroactively restores when a defaulted loan recovers -- sponsors aren't permanently penalized for borrowers who eventually make good

### Credit Bureau Reporting (Roadmap)

Reporting microloan repayment to credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax) transforms Deluge microloans from a community tool into a real credit-building pathway. This is a major differentiator for borrowers who need conventional credit (mortgages, auto loans, credit cards) but lack credit history.

**Why this matters:**

- ~45 million Americans are "credit invisible" (no credit score) or "unscorable"
- Successfully repaying a Deluge microloan builds real credit history
- This makes the microloan program genuinely life-changing, not just a nice community feature
- Attracts borrowers who are motivated to repay (credit score is a powerful incentive)

**Implementation roadmap:**

| Phase | Timing | What | Cost Estimate |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Research & legal | Year 2 | FCRA compliance review, Metro 2 format research, credit bureau partnership requirements | $15-25K (legal fees) |
| Partnership | Year 2-3 | Establish data furnisher agreements with at least 2 bureaus | $10-20K (setup fees) + ongoing compliance |
| Integration | Year 3 | Build Metro 2 reporting pipeline, dispute resolution system, compliance monitoring | $50-75K (engineering) |
| Launch | Year 3-4 | Begin reporting for new loans, backfill eligible existing loans | Ongoing compliance costs ~$5-10K/year |

**Total estimated cost: $75-120K over Years 2-4.**

**Compliance requirements (FCRA):**

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Accuracy | Must report accurately; errors create legal liability |
| Dispute resolution | Must investigate and resolve borrower disputes within 30 days |
| Data format | Metro 2 format (industry standard for credit reporting) |
| Consent | Borrower must consent to credit reporting at loan origination |
| Opt-in model | Borrowers choose whether their loan is credit-reported (recommended approach) |

**Impact on the business model:**

| Effect | How |
|--------|-----|
| Improved repayment rates | Borrowers protecting their credit score are more likely to repay -- estimated 5-10% improvement in repayment rates |
| Stronger borrower acquisition | "Build your credit with a 0% interest microloan" is a compelling value proposition |
| Higher engagement | Borrowers checking credit progress creates recurring app visits |
| Mission alignment | Genuinely helping people build financial futures, not just deploying capital |
| Platform differentiation | Few community lending platforms offer credit bureau reporting |

**Revenue impact:** Credit bureau reporting doesn't directly generate revenue, but improved repayment rates mean less capital lost to defaults and more recycled through the watershed. At a 5% improvement in repayment rates on the base scenario, approximately $22K in additional capital would be recovered and recycled by Year 5.

This feature should not be rushed. FCRA compliance is serious -- inaccurate reporting creates real legal exposure. Plan for Year 3-4 launch with thorough legal preparation starting in Year 2.

## Project Tags & Categories

Projects are organized by **tags**, not rigid categories. Tags are flexible labels that help users discover projects. A single project can have multiple tags (e.g., "education" + "local" + "youth" + "Denver").

The community drives what gets funded. Deluge verifies legitimacy and tracks impact, but does not curate or editorialize which projects deserve funding.

## Community Dynamics & Network Effects

Deluge's long-term distinctiveness depends on community network effects -- the compounding value that deepens the platform's unique strengths as it grows. This section analyzes how community dynamics drive business metrics and where those distinctive strengths compound.

### How Community Size Affects Cascade Rate

A cascade (project fully funded) is the core emotional event on the platform. Cascades create shareable moments, drive re-engagement, and prove the platform works. Cascade frequency is directly tied to community size.

| Community Size | Avg. Project Funding Goal | Monthly Contribution Pool (cash + ad contributions) | Projects Fundable Per Month | Cascade Frequency |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 100 members | $2,000 | ~$500 | 0.25 (1 every 4 months) | Too slow -- users lose faith |
| 500 members | $3,000 | ~$3,000 | 1 | Minimum viable -- monthly cascades |
| 2,000 members | $5,000 | ~$15,000 | 3 | Healthy -- weekly or biweekly |
| 10,000 members | $10,000 | ~$80,000 | 8 | Strong -- multiple per week |

**The 500-member threshold is critical.** Below 500 members, a community can't fund a meaningful project within a reasonable timeframe. Users who join a sub-500 community see stalled projects and leave. This means Deluge must seed communities to 500 members before they become self-sustaining. Early-stage strategy should concentrate users in fewer, denser communities rather than spreading them across many small ones.

### Network Effects by Type

| Effect | Mechanism | Strength | When It Kicks In |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Same-side (community)** | More members → more projects proposed → more interesting options → more members join | Strong | 500+ members per community |
| **Cross-side (projects ↔ funders)** | More funders → more projects get funded → more proposers submit → more funders see results | Strong | 50+ funded projects on the platform |
| **Cross-side (businesses ↔ browsers)** | More business listings → more useful directory → more browsing → more businesses list | Moderate | 30+ businesses per market |
| **Data network effect** | More users → better project recommendations, better impact data, better ad targeting | Weak initially, strong at scale | 50K+ users |
| **Social / referral** | Users invite friends → friends join same communities → community grows → more value for everyone | Strong | From Day 1 |

### Community as a Retention Driver

Users who join a community and see a cascade are significantly harder to churn than solo users.

| User Type | Expected 90-Day Retention | Why |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----|
| Solo user (no community) | 15-20% | No social ties. Feels like any other charity app. |
| Community member (no cascade seen) | 25-35% | Social connection, but no proof the model works. |
| Community member (saw a cascade) | 40-55% | Emotional proof that collective action produces real outcomes. |
| Community member (contributed to a cascade) | 55-70% | Personal stake in a visible outcome. This is the retention goldmine. |

**Implication:** Getting users to their first cascade contribution as fast as possible is the single most important retention lever. Onboarding should funnel users into active communities with near-term cascade potential, not into empty or early-stage communities.

### Community Health Indicators

These metrics predict whether a community will thrive or stall.

| Indicator | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Active members (monthly) | > 40% of total members | 20-40% | < 20% -- community is dying |
| Projects proposed (monthly) | 2+ per 500 members | 1 per 500 | 0 -- no one is proposing. Needs seeding. |
| Cascade rate | 1+ per month per 500 members | 1 every 2-3 months | < 1 per quarter -- users losing faith |
| Discussion activity | Daily posts/comments | Weekly | Monthly or less -- community is a ghost town |
| New member growth | 5%+ monthly | 1-5% | Negative -- community is shrinking |

### What Makes Deluge's Approach Distinctive

| Asset | Why It Matters | Time to Develop |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Technology (app, payment processing) | Table stakes -- any well-resourced team can build giving infrastructure | 3-6 months |
| Community relationships | Trust and social ties take time and can't be shortcut | 2-3 years |
| Project history + impact data | Verified outcomes compound over time, creating a living record of community impact | 2-4 years |
| Local business directory | Requires market-by-market relationships and density | 1-2 years per market |
| Borrower credit history + sponsorship networks | Reputation systems are built through years of real interactions | 3-5 years |
| Brand association with sustainable giving | Earned through consistent delivery on the transparency promise | 1-2 years |

**Deluge's distinctive asset is the community graph + impact history.** Technology is commodity, but the accumulated record of funded projects, verified outcomes, community relationships, borrower credit histories, and sponsor reputation scores is unique. Every cascade, every repaid loan adds to a data and trust asset that compounds over time.

### How Deluge Complements Other Giving Platforms

More options for givers is good for the ecosystem. If a major platform, a well-funded startup, or an established giving service adds community giving features, that expands the overall space for collective giving -- and Deluge welcomes it. Here's how Deluge's depth in community-driven giving remains distinctive:

| Scenario | How Deluge Complements |
|----------|----------------------|
| Another platform adds "community giving" features | Deluge's model goes deeper than a giving feature -- watershed mechanics, cascades, microloans, and impact tracking are built into the core, not layered on. Users who want depth in community giving will find it here. |
| Another platform launches community-funded projects | More community-funded projects in the world is a good thing. Deluge's strength is in specific communities with deep ties -- 500+ member communities, funded project histories, and impact data that users have built together. |
| Another platform offers ad-funded giving | Deluge's multi-pathway model (ads + business cards + referrals) provides a broader on-ramp. The combined free-tier pathways create distinctive flexibility for users with no cash to spare. |
| A dedicated giving platform launches | The giving ecosystem benefits from more participants. Deluge's focus is community density in specific markets, strong brand identity around transparency, and deep community ties (project history, achievements, sponsorship reputation) that users build over time. |

## Unit Economics

### Per User (Year 1 Assumptions -- Conservative)

**Average cash contribution per user:** $30 total in Year 1 (not $75)
- Initial: $5-10
- Monthly additions: $2-3
- Many users will try it once or twice, then contribute primarily through ads
- Some users contribute only through ads ($0 in cash)
- Cash contributions are pure giving -- users won't contribute as much as they would invest in themselves

**Platform revenue per user (blended across all user types):**

| Source | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% cut (avg 2 ads/day across all users) | $1.75/yr | $3.50/yr | $5.84/yr |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% cut (blended ~1.5 views/day in Year 1) | $0.22/yr | $0.44/yr | $0.88/yr |
| Business directory enhanced listings (blended across all users) | $0.50/yr | $1.50/yr | $3.00/yr |
| Corporate/institutional revenue (blended, Year 1 is minimal) | $0.05/yr | $0.20/yr | $0.50/yr |
| Microloan servicing + sponsorship (blended, Year 1 is minimal) | $0.05/yr | $0.15/yr | $0.40/yr |
| Custodial float income (interest on watershed balances, allocated per user) | $0.44/yr | $0.88/yr | $1.50/yr |
| **Total Year 1 per user** | **$3.01** | **$6.67** | **$12.12** |

*Video ad revenue = avg views/day x 365 x eCPM rate x 40% platform cut. Most users watch 0-3 ads/day; blended average ~2/day.*
*Business card revenue = blended browsing activity x 365 x per-view rate x 40% platform cut. Year 1 is low -- the business card directory launches market-by-market with limited listings. Per-user revenue grows as more markets and businesses join (estimated $0.80/yr in Year 2, $1.20/yr in Year 3, $1.50/yr in Year 4, $1.80/yr in Year 5).*
*Business directory listing revenue = total enhanced listing fees / total users. Grows as Deluge expands to more markets.*
*Custodial float income = aggregate watershed balances x interest rate / total users. Conservative assumes 2% rate and lower balances; base assumes 4.5%; optimistic assumes 5% and higher balances. Float income grows as user count and average balances increase, but is interest-rate dependent.*
*Note: Cash contributions feed the watershed and fund projects/microloans but do not generate platform revenue directly. Platform revenue comes from ads, business directory listings, corporate partnerships, microloan servicing, sponsorship, and custodial float income.*

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**

| Channel | Cost | Reality Check |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Paid ads (Facebook/Instagram) | $15-30 per signup | Social impact app avg is $15-40 |
| Paid ads (Google) | $25-50 per signup | Competitive keywords |
| Organic (content, PR, word-of-mouth) | $3-8 per signup | Requires strong content and brand |
| Referral program | $2.50-3.00 per signup | Watershed credits from marketing budget; most cost-efficient channel |
| **Blended average** | **$12-22** | Assumes 25% referral, 20% organic, 55% paid |

Referral credits are the cheapest acquisition channel by a wide margin. At $2.75 per acquired user versus $20+ for paid ads, every referral saves $17+ in marketing spend. The blended CAC drops from $15-25 (without referrals) to $12-22 as the referral program scales. This is why the referral program is funded from the marketing budget -- it's a direct substitution for more expensive paid acquisition.

**Lifetime Value (LTV) -- 3-Year:**

| Scenario | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | 3-Year LTV |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Conservative | $3.01 | $5.75 | $8.50 | $17.26 |
| Base | $6.67 | $12.30 | $18.50 | $37.47 |
| Optimistic | $12.12 | $22.80 | $34.00 | $68.92 |

*Includes business card and directory revenue growing from Year 1 through Year 3 as the directory expands to more markets. Corporate/institutional revenue grows significantly in Years 2-3. Custodial float income grows with aggregate watershed balances.*

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**

| Scenario | LTV | CAC | Ratio | Viable? |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|---------|
| Conservative | $17 | $22 | 0.8:1 | No -- still needs organic growth and directory scale |
| Base | $37 | $17 | 2.2:1 | Viable -- referral program, B2B revenue, and custodial float close the gap |
| Optimistic | $69 | $12 | 5.8:1 | Healthy |

**Key insight:** Custodial float income pushes the base LTV:CAC ratio past the 2:1 viability threshold (2.2:1) without charging users a cent. Every dollar sitting in a watershed earns interest for the platform while remaining fully available to the user. Combined with B2B revenue and the referral program's impact on CAC, the unit economics work -- but they depend on multiple streams reinforcing each other. No single stream carries the model. Every individual feature is free, so user acquisition is frictionless -- and the business works because diversified revenue (attention-funded + B2B + float) scales alongside the user base.

## Financial Projections (5-Year, Three Scenarios)

### User Growth

| Year | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|------|-------------|------|-----------|
| 1 (validation) | 1,000 | 3,000 | 5,000 |
| 2 (seed-funded) | 5,000 | 12,000 | 25,000 |
| 3 | 15,000 | 35,000 | 75,000 |
| 4 | 30,000 | 75,000 | 150,000 |
| 5 | 60,000 | 150,000 | 300,000 |

Year 1 user growth is lower because the platform is founder-built with AI tools and marketing is primarily organic. Once the core loop is validated, seed funding in Year 2 accelerates growth through paid acquisition and the referral program. Years 3-5 follow a standard scaling trajectory.

### Year 1 -- Founder-Built Validation (BASE Scenario)

Year 1 is not a funded startup year. It's a validation year. The founder builds the MVP using AI development tools, launches in one community, and proves whether the core loop works: communities → contributions → projects → cascades → retention. Total cash outlay is under $15K.

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% (3K users x $3.50/yr blended) | $10.5K |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% (3K users x $0.44/yr blended) | $1.3K |
| Business directory enhanced listings (~20 businesses x $15/mo x 6 months) | $1.8K |
| Custodial float income (avg $45K aggregate watershed x 4.5%) | $2K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$16K** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Legal (entity formation, terms/privacy, money transmission analysis) | $5K |
| AI development tools (Claude, Cursor, hosting, database) | $3K |
| Marketing (organic + small paid tests to validate CAC) | $5K |
| Domain + email + misc infrastructure | $500 |
| **Total Costs** | **$14K** |

| **Net** | **+$2K** (break-even) |
|---------|------------|

**Why this works:** The founder builds the MVP with AI tools instead of hiring a $115K engineering team. Legal costs drop to essentials only ($5K vs. $40K) because the platform is small enough to defer non-critical compliance work. Marketing is primarily organic -- posting in community groups, content marketing, word-of-mouth in one neighborhood. The goal is not 8,000 users; it's 3,000 users who prove the model works. Business directory launches in one market mid-year with ~20 local businesses. Microloans and corporate partnerships are not built yet -- they're Year 2+ features.

**What Year 1 must prove:**
1. Users join and stay (30%+ 90-day retention)
2. Users watch ads to fund projects (3+ ads/day average among active users)
3. The cascade moment drives sharing and retention
4. Local businesses will list (and some will pay for enhanced)
5. The core loop generates enough engagement to sustain a community

### Year 2 -- Seed-Funded Growth (BASE Scenario)

Year 1 validated the core loop. Year 2 is the first funded year: raise a seed round ($150-300K), hire 1-2 people, scale marketing, and build the features that were deferred (microloans, referral program, business directory expansion).

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% (12K users x $3.75/yr blended) | $45K |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% (12K users x $0.80/yr blended) | $9.6K |
| Business directory enhanced listings (~80 businesses x $18/mo avg) | $17K |
| Corporate ESG + Impact Matching Funds (1 early client x $15K) | $15K |
| Microloan servicing fees (launches mid-year) | $2K |
| Cascade/notification sponsorship | $5K |
| Custodial float income (avg $240K aggregate watershed x 4.5%) | $11K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$105K** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Legal/compliance (ongoing + microloan setup) | $15K |
| Technology (infrastructure scaling, contractor for microloans) | $40K |
| Marketing (includes ~$4K referral credits) | $35K |
| Operations | $15K |
| Team (1-2 FTE, first hires) | $100K |
| **Total Costs** | **$205K** |

| **Net** | **-$100K** |
|---------|------------|

### Year 3 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% (35K users x $4.00/yr blended) | $140K |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% (35K users x $1.20/yr blended) | $42K |
| Business directory enhanced listings (~200 businesses x $20/mo avg) | $48K |
| Corporate ESG + Impact Matching Funds (3 clients x $20K) | $60K |
| Microloan servicing fees | $8K |
| Cascade/notification sponsorship | $20K |
| Institutional partnerships (early) | $10K |
| Custodial float income (avg $875K aggregate watershed x 4.5%) | $39K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$367K** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Legal/compliance | $30K |
| Technology (includes ad platform + business directory scaling) | $100K |
| Marketing (includes ~$10K referral credits) | $80K |
| Operations | $40K |
| Team (3 FTE) | $250K |
| **Total Costs** | **$500K** |

| **Net** | **-$133K** (gap closing) |
|---------|------------|

### Year 4 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% (75K users x $4.50/yr blended) | $338K |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% (75K users x $1.50/yr blended) | $113K |
| Business directory enhanced listings (~400 businesses x $22/mo avg) | $106K |
| Corporate ESG + Impact Matching Funds (5 clients x $25K) | $125K |
| Microloan servicing fees | $20K |
| Cascade/notification sponsorship | $50K |
| Institutional partnerships | $40K |
| Custodial float income (avg $2.25M aggregate watershed x 4.5%) | $101K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$893K** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| **Total Costs** | **$750K** |

| **Net** | **+$143K** (break-even achieved) |
|---------|------------|

### Year 5 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Video ad revenue -- platform's 40% (150K users x $5.00/yr blended) | $750K |
| Business card revenue -- platform's 40% (150K users x $1.80/yr blended) | $270K |
| Business directory enhanced listings (~800 businesses x $25/mo avg) | $240K |
| Corporate ESG + Impact Matching Funds (8 clients x $35K) | $280K |
| Microloan servicing fees | $50K |
| Cascade/notification sponsorship | $85K |
| Institutional partnerships | $80K |
| Aggregate impact data + reporting | $25K |
| Custodial float income (avg $5.25M aggregate watershed x 4.5%) | $236K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$2.016M** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| **Total Costs** | **$1.2M** |

| **Net** | **+$816K** |
|---------|------------|

### Cumulative Funding Needed (Base Scenario)

| Through Year | Cumulative Net | External Capital Needed |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Year 1 (founder-built) | +$2K | $0 (self-funded, break-even) |
| Year 2 (seed-funded) | -$98K | $150-300K seed round |
| Year 3 | -$231K | Covered by seed round |
| Year 4 | -$88K | Recovering from operations |
| Year 5 | +$728K | Profitable |

**Reality check:** The founder-built validation path fundamentally changes the capital story. Year 1 costs $14K instead of $225K because the founder builds the MVP with AI tools. This means:

- **No external funding needed until the core loop is proven.** Year 1 is self-funded and break-even. If the model doesn't work, you've lost $14K, not $225K.
- **The seed round is smaller.** Total external capital needed: **$150-300K** (one seed round after validation), versus $500-650K in a funded-from-Day-1 model.
- **Break-even is still Year 4** but with dramatically less capital at risk. The cumulative loss never exceeds ~$231K.
- **Revenue diversifies across 9 streams** by Year 5. Combined attention-funded revenue (video ads + business cards) reaches $1.02M, representing 51% of total revenue. Business directory enhanced listings grow from $1.8K in Year 1 to $240K by Year 5 as the directory expands across markets. Custodial float income grows from $2K in Year 1 to $236K in Year 5 -- interest-rate dependent but meaningful at current rates.
- **The tradeoff is speed.** The founder-built path reaches 150K users in Year 5 versus 250K in the funded-from-Day-1 model. Growth starts slower (3K vs. 8K in Year 1) but the total capital risked is 60-70% less.

## Revenue Model Stress Test

The base scenario projects $2.016M in Year 5 revenue across 9 streams. The model depends on a diversified mix of attention-funded monetization, B2B revenue, and custodial float income. This section tests what happens when individual streams underperform, and identifies which ones are load-bearing vs. supplementary.

### Year 5 Base Revenue Breakdown (Reference)

| Stream | Amount | % of Total | Category |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Video ad revenue | $750K | 37.2% | Moderate confidence (depends on eCPM) |
| Business card revenue | $270K | 13.4% | Moderate confidence (grows with directory) |
| Business directory enhanced listings | $240K | 11.9% | Moderate confidence (B2B sales required) |
| Corporate ESG + matching | $280K | 13.9% | Speculative (B2B sales required) |
| Custodial float income | $236K | 11.7% | High confidence at current rates, interest-rate dependent |
| Cascade/notification sponsorship | $85K | 4.2% | Speculative (new format) |
| Institutional partnerships | $80K | 4.0% | Speculative (enterprise sales) |
| Microloan servicing fees | $50K | 2.5% | Low confidence (depends on loan volume) |
| Aggregate data + reporting | $25K | 1.2% | Speculative (Year 5+) |
| **Total** | **$2.016M** | **100%** | |

Year 5 costs: $1.2M. Base net: +$816K.

### Individual Stream Stress Tests

Each scenario cuts one revenue stream by 50% while holding everything else constant.

| Scenario | What Underperforms | Year 5 Net | Still Profitable? | Impact |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Base (reference)** | Nothing | +$816K | Yes | -- |
| **A: Video ads at 50%** | Ad rates come in at $7-8 CPM instead of $15 | +$441K | Yes (thinner) | High -- largest single stream |
| **B: Custodial float at near-zero** | Interest rates drop to 0.5% (low-rate environment) | +$606K | Yes | Moderate -- $210K reduction |
| **C: Business cards at 50%** | Directory grows slower, fewer markets, lower browse rates | +$681K | Yes | Low -- supplementary stream |
| **D: Business directory at 50%** | Fewer businesses pay for enhanced listings | +$696K | Yes | Low -- still building |
| **E: Corporate matching at 50%** | Fewer corporate partners, smaller fund commitments | +$676K | Yes | Low -- Year 2+ revenue, not launch-critical |

**Conclusion from individual tests:** No single stream at 50% kills the business. Video ads at 50% is the most impactful single-stream failure, cutting net profit nearly in half -- but the business remains profitable. The 9-stream diversification means no single point of failure exists.

### Combined Stress Tests

Real-world underperformance rarely hits one stream in isolation. These scenarios combine multiple headwinds.

**Scenario F: All speculative B2B streams at 50%**

Corporate matching, sponsorship, institutional partnerships, and data reporting all underperform by 50%. Attention-funded revenue, directory, and float hold at base.

| Year | Base Revenue | Adjusted Revenue | Base Costs | Net |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|-----|
| Year 4 | $893K | $800K | $750K | +$50K |
| Year 5 | $2.016M | $1.781M | $1.2M | +$581K |

Still profitable. The speculative B2B streams are gravy -- the core business runs on attention-funded revenue, business directory listings, and custodial float.

**Scenario G: Ad ecosystem underperforms (eCPM at 50% across video AND business cards)**

Lower-than-expected ad rates affect both video ads and business card revenue simultaneously, since both depend on advertiser willingness to pay for the audience.

| Year | Base Revenue | Adjusted Revenue | Base Costs | Net |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|-----|
| Year 4 | $893K | $668K | $750K | -$82K |
| Year 5 | $2.016M | $1.506M | $1.2M | +$306K |

**Year 4 is not profitable if the entire ad ecosystem underperforms.** Profitability delays to Year 5 with a thinner margin. Attention-funded revenue (video ads + business cards) represents 50.6% of Year 5 revenue -- halving it is the most dangerous single-category failure.

**Scenario G: Referral program fails + higher CAC**

Referrals don't materialize. Blended CAC reverts from $12-22 to $15-25 (pre-referral estimates). This is a cost increase, not a revenue decrease -- roughly $3-5 per user acquired.

| Year | Additional Marketing Cost | Base Net | Adjusted Net |
|------|--------------------------|---------|-------------|
| Year 3 (+20K new users) | +$60K-100K | -$133K | -$193K to -$233K |
| Year 4 (+40K new users) | +$120K-200K | +$143K | -$57K to +$23K |
| Year 5 (+75K new users) | +$225K-375K | +$816K | +$441K to +$591K |

Year 4 break-even is at risk. Total capital needed increases from $150-300K to $300-500K. The referral program's cost efficiency remains critical for unit economics.

**Scenario I: Worst case -- ad eCPM at 50% + no corporate matching + referral program fails + low interest rates**

Four headwinds simultaneously: attention-funded revenue halved, corporate matching revenue zeroed, user acquisition costs revert to pre-referral levels, and interest rates drop to 0.5%.

| Year | Base Revenue | Adjusted Revenue | Base Costs | Adjusted Costs | Net |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Year 4 | $893K | $428K | $750K | $870K | -$442K |
| Year 5 | $2.016M | $976K | $1.2M | $1.43M | -$454K |

**Not profitable through Year 5 under worst case.** The business does not work if attention-funded revenue is halved, corporate partnerships fail, user acquisition costs are high, and interest rates collapse simultaneously. However: (1) this requires four independent headwinds to hit simultaneously -- a low-probability combination, and (2) the total capital at risk is much smaller in the founder-built path. Year 1 is self-funded. The seed round is $150-300K. Even in the worst case, you've risked $150-300K in external capital, not $500K+.

### Load-Bearing vs. Supplementary Streams

| Stream | Classification | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Video ad revenue** | **Load-bearing** | Largest stream (37.2%). Combined with business cards, attention-funded revenue is 50.6% of Year 5. Halving it pushes Year 4 to a loss. |
| **Custodial float income** | **Load-bearing (rate-dependent)** | 11.7% of Year 5 revenue. High confidence at current rates, but collapses in a low-rate environment. Treat as reliable in medium-rate scenarios, supplementary in low-rate planning. |
| **Business card revenue** | **Moderate** | 13.4% alone is manageable. Combined with video ads it's part of the core attention-funded engine. |
| **Business directory listings** | **Load-bearing** | 11.9% of Year 5 revenue and the primary B2B stream. At 50%, manageable. At 0%, the model is strained. |
| **Corporate ESG + matching** | **Supplementary** | 13.9% of revenue, and it's Year 2+ anyway. Delayed or halved, the impact is manageable. Don't build financial plans around it. |
| **Other B2B (microloan, sponsorship, institutional, data)** | **Supplementary** | Combined 11.9%. Diversification value. At 0%, the core business still works. |
| **Referral program (cost efficiency)** | **Critical** | Failing referrals don't reduce revenue but increase costs. The referral program's CAC reduction is what makes unit economics viable. |

### What This Means for Prioritization

1. **Ad engagement is the #1 business risk.** Attention-funded revenue (video ads + business card browsing) is the largest revenue category at 50.6%. If eCPM comes in at half projections, Year 4 is not profitable. Validate eCPM assumptions in Year 1 with real users and have a fallback plan (direct-sold sponsorship ads from mission-aligned brands).
2. **Business directory adoption is the #2 risk.** Enhanced listings are a new B2B product that needs local sales execution market by market. If businesses don't see value in paying $15-25/month for enhanced features, this stream underperforms. Validate in Year 1 in one market.
3. **User retention is the #3 risk.** Without subscription lock-in, retention depends entirely on engagement. The cascade experience is the key retention lever -- users who see a cascade retain at 2-3x the rate of those who don't. Getting users to their first cascade fast is existential. Retention also directly affects custodial float income -- more retained users = larger aggregate balances = more interest.
4. **Interest rate environment is a background risk.** Custodial float income is 11.7% of Year 5 revenue at current rates but near-zero in a low-rate environment. Don't budget against high-rate assumptions. Treat current rates as upside and plan for the business to work at 2% rates.
5. **Corporate matching and other B2B are gravy.** Model them conservatively. Don't hire against them. If they outperform, reinvest. If they underperform, the core business still works.
6. **The referral program is critical infrastructure.** It's the mechanism that makes unit economics viable. Without it, blended CAC rises and the LTV:CAC ratio drops. Invest in Year 2 when the seed round funds marketing.

## Funding Requirements (Revised)

### Founder-Built Path (Recommended)

| Phase | Funding Source | Cost | What It Proves |
|-------|---------------|------|---------------|
| Phase 0 (Concept validation) | Self-funded | $2-5K | Landing page tests, surveys, community interest |
| Year 1 (AI-built MVP + launch) | Self-funded | $10-15K | Core loop works: communities, contributions, ads, cascades, retention |
| Year 2 (Seed round + first hires) | Angel/seed investors | $150-300K | Product scales with marketing spend and paid acquisition |
| Years 3-5 (Growth) | Revenue-funded or Series A | Revenue + $0-500K | Business reaches profitability at 75K+ users |

**Total external capital needed: $150-300K** (one seed round after Year 1 validation). The founder builds Year 1 with AI tools, proving the model before risking investor money.

### Traditional Venture Path (If Applicable)

| Round | Amount | Timing | What It Proves |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Pre-seed | $150-300K | After Year 1 validation + 3K users | Core loop works, people use it |
| Seed | $500K-1M | After 12K+ users, clear retention | Product scales |
| Series A | $3-7M | After 50K+ users, Year 4 profitability | Business works |

### Total to Launch + Year 1 (Founder-Built)

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Legal (entity formation, terms, privacy, money transmission analysis) | $3-8K | Essentials only. Defer non-critical compliance until Year 2. |
| AI development tools (Claude, Cursor, etc.) | $1-2K | Annual subscriptions for AI-assisted development |
| Hosting + infrastructure (database, Vercel/Railway) | $1-2K | Scales with usage. Minimal at 3K users. |
| Marketing (organic + small paid tests) | $3-8K | Content marketing, community outreach, $500-1K in paid ads to validate CAC |
| Domain + email + misc | $500 | |
| **Total Year 1** | **$10-20K** | |

The founder-built approach eliminates the $115K engineering cost, the $40K legal cost, and the $25K operations cost from the funded-startup model. What remains is the irreducible minimum: legal entity, tools, hosting, and enough marketing to get 3,000 users into the door. Custodial float income begins generating revenue from Day 1 of watershed deposits. Total capital to reach profitability: **$150-300K in external funding** (seed round in Year 2), with break-even in Year 4.

## Key Assumptions to Validate in Year 1

These are the make-or-break questions. Year 1's purpose is to answer them with real users for under $15K. If any answer is "no," the model needs to change before raising seed funding.

1. **Does "community-driven giving" resonate as a concept?** (Will people sign up for a platform focused on transparent, collective community giving?)
2. **Will users watch ads to fund community projects?** (Is "donate your attention" compelling enough to drive daily engagement? This is the #1 revenue risk -- attention-funded revenue is 50.6% of Year 5 projections.)
3. **Can we achieve $8-15 eCPM consistently?** (Ad rates fluctuate seasonally and by market conditions. Year 1 provides real eCPM data from actual users.)
4. **Will local businesses pay $15-25/month for enhanced directory listings?** (Business directory is the primary B2B revenue stream and the anchor that replaces subscription revenue.)
5. **Is the CAC achievable below $20?** (If not, unit economics don't work -- especially without subscription revenue boosting LTV)
6. **Can we retain 30%+ MAU after Month 3?** (Without subscription lock-in, retention depends entirely on engagement. The cascade experience is the key retention lever.)
7. **Will users refer friends for watershed credits?** (Referral programs only work if the product is worth recommending -- and without subscriptions, the referral program's CAC reduction is what makes unit economics viable)
8. **Can we sign corporate partners for ad matching funds?** (ESG budgets exist, but is "match ad-funded community impact" a compelling enough product to sell?)
9. **Will interest rates remain above 2%?** (Custodial float income is 14.4% of Year 5 revenue at current rates. In a low-rate environment it drops to near-zero. Not a make-or-break assumption, but it affects the margin of safety.)

## Phase 0 Validation Plan

Phase 0 costs $900-2,000 and happens before the MVP is built. In the founder-built path, Phase 0 runs during the first 2-3 months of Year 1, overlapping with early AI-assisted development. The goal is to kill bad assumptions cheaply. Each test below is ordered by priority: the first failures should stop the project or force a fundamental pivot before committing to the full MVP build.

### Test Sequence

Tests are grouped into three waves. Each wave should produce clear pass/fail signals before committing to the next.

#### Wave 1: Core Concept (Weeks 1-3, ~$500-1,000)

These test whether the fundamental value proposition resonates. If these fail, nothing else matters.

**Test 1: Core Concept Resonance**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Does "community-driven giving where small contributions add up to fund real projects" resonate? |
| Method | Landing page A/B test. Version A: "Fund what matters in your community. Give cash or give attention. See exactly where it goes." Version B: "Your neighborhood's giving platform. Every dollar and every ad view funds real community projects." Version C: "Where communities fund what matters." Drive $200-400 in paid traffic to each. |
| Measure | Email signup conversion rate per variant. Target: 5%+ on the best variant. |
| Pass | At least one variant converts above 5%. Qualitative feedback shows understanding and interest. |
| Fail | All variants below 3%. People don't understand the concept or don't find it compelling. |
| If it fails | The community giving framing needs work. Consider: emphasizing specific project types (education, environment), leading with the zero-dollar pathway, or targeting a more specific community (neighborhood-level rather than broad). |

**Test 2: Ad-Funded Giving Concept**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Is "watch ads to fund community projects" compelling enough to drive daily behavior? |
| Method | Landing page variant that leads with the zero-dollar pathway: "Fund real projects in your community. No money required. Just your attention." Measure signup conversion separately from the concept-focused variants. Post-signup survey: "How often would you watch ads to fund a community project?" (Daily / A few times a week / Rarely / Never). |
| Measure | Signup conversion rate. Survey distribution of intended frequency. |
| Pass | Conversion rate comparable to concept-focused variants. 40%+ say "daily" or "a few times a week." |
| Fail | Conversion rate significantly lower than concept-focused variants. Majority say "rarely" or "never." |
| If it fails | Ad-funded giving doesn't drive engagement. **This is the most dangerous failure** -- attention-funded revenue is 56.6% of Year 5 projections. If users won't watch ads, the revenue model needs fundamental rethinking. Consider: direct-sold sponsorship ads from mission-aligned brands, or explore whether the platform can sustain itself on B2B revenue alone (business directory + corporate partnerships). |

#### Wave 2: Engagement Mechanics (Weeks 3-6, ~$500-1,000)

These test whether the specific participation mechanisms will sustain engagement beyond initial signup.

**Test 3: Local Business Directory + Enhanced Listings**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Will local businesses list themselves? Will users browse a community business directory? Will businesses pay $15-25/month for enhanced listings? |
| Method | Approach 10-15 local businesses in one neighborhood. Pitch: "Free listing in a community app. Your neighbors see your card, and every view funds a local project. You get exposure and community impact credit." Track sign-up rate. Then pitch the enhanced listing: "For $15-25/month, get featured placement, analytics dashboard, project sponsorship badge, and priority visibility." Track upgrade interest. Separately, show the browsing concept to 20-30 potential users: "Browse local businesses in your neighborhood. Every card you view funds a community project." Track stated interest in browsing. |
| Measure | Business listing conversion rate (% who agree to free listing). Enhanced listing interest (% who express willingness to pay). User interest in browsing (stated frequency). |
| Pass | 50%+ of approached businesses agree to a free listing. 20%+ express interest in enhanced features at $15-25/month. 30%+ of potential users say they'd browse at least weekly. |
| Fail | Businesses aren't interested or don't understand the value. No interest in paid enhanced listings. Users don't see a reason to browse (already use Google/Yelp). |
| If it fails | If businesses won't list: consider seeding the directory from public data (Google Places) with an opt-in upgrade to claimed listings. If businesses won't pay for enhanced: reduce pricing or explore alternative B2B monetization (per-lead fees, sponsored community projects). If users won't browse: make business cards a passive background element in other flows rather than a standalone browsing experience. **This is a critical test** -- business directory enhanced listings are the primary B2B revenue stream replacing subscriptions. |

**Test 4: Referral Willingness**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Will people refer friends for watershed credits, or does it feel too transactional? |
| Method | In the post-signup survey from Wave 1, add: "If you could earn $2.50 in community impact credit for each friend who joins and stays active, would you share the app with friends?" Options: "Yes, I'd share with several people" / "Maybe 1-2 people" / "No, I don't like referral programs" / "I'd share it anyway, credits or not." |
| Measure | Distribution across options. Ratio of "would share anyway" to "only for credits." |
| Pass | 50%+ say they'd share with at least 1-2 people. A meaningful portion (20%+) say they'd share regardless of credits. |
| Fail | Majority say they don't like referral programs. Credits feel like a bribe rather than a bonus. |
| If it fails | The referral program still works mechanically, but marketing should emphasize community-building ("bring your friends into the movement") rather than credit incentives. Reduce the credit amount and increase the emotional framing. |

#### Wave 3: Market Feasibility (Weeks 5-8, ~$500-1,500)

These test whether the business can actually operate.

**Test 5: Ad Network Viability**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Can Deluge achieve $8-15 eCPM with impact-focused ad inventory? |
| Method | Research ad network options (Google AdMob, Unity Ads, AppLovin, ironSource). Contact 2-3 networks about expected eCPM for: 30-second rewarded video, community/social impact app audience, US market. Compare with published eCPM benchmarks for rewarded video in similar categories. |
| Measure | Estimated eCPM range from network conversations. Comparison with the $8-15 range assumed in projections. |
| Pass | At least one network confirms $8+ eCPM is realistic for rewarded video in a social impact app. |
| Fail | All networks estimate below $8 eCPM. Impact/social good inventory is undervalued by advertisers. |
| If it fails | Reduce ad revenue projections by 30-50%. **This is a serious problem** -- attention-funded revenue is the largest revenue category (56.6% of Year 5). At half projections, Year 4 break-even is at risk. Consider supplementing with direct-sold sponsorship ads from mission-aligned brands (higher eCPM but requires sales effort) or explore alternative attention-funded formats. |

**Test 6: Corporate Matching Interest**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| What to test | Will corporate ESG teams pay for an ad-matching product? |
| Method | Draft a 1-page pitch for the "Impact Matching Fund" product. Approach 5-10 companies with ESG programs (start with local companies, B Corps, companies with visible CSR pages). Pitch: "Your brand matches the impact of community ad views. $25K fund, 5x match, your logo on every matched project. Full impact reporting." |
| Measure | Meeting conversion rate. Level of interest (polite decline vs. genuine interest vs. "send me a proposal"). |
| Pass | At least 2 companies request a follow-up meeting or proposal. |
| Fail | Universal polite decline. ESG teams don't understand the product or don't have budget authority for this type of spend. |
| If it fails | Corporate matching is Year 2+ revenue anyway. Delay the product until the platform has traction data to show. Focus initial corporate outreach on simpler products (employee giving programs, white-label impact pages) and introduce matching funds once there's proven ad engagement data to sell against. |

### Phase 0 Decision Framework

After all tests are complete, score the results:

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Tests 1-2 both pass | Core concept and ad-funded pathway validated. Proceed to Phase 1 (legal + partnerships). |
| Test 1 fails | Fundamental concept question. Pivot the giving model framing or reconsider the approach. |
| Test 2 fails | Ad-funded pathway doesn't drive engagement. **This is serious** -- attention-funded revenue is 56.6% of projections. Reduce ad revenue projections significantly and explore alternative monetization. May still proceed if Test 3 (business directory) is strong. |
| Tests 3-4 mixed results | Engagement mechanics need adjustment but aren't fatal. Proceed with modifications. |
| Test 3 fails (business directory) | **Critical** -- business directory is the primary B2B revenue stream. If businesses won't list or won't pay for enhanced features, the revenue model needs rethinking. Explore alternative B2B products. |
| Test 5 fails (ad eCPM) | Reduce ad revenue projections by 30-50%. Consider direct-sold sponsorship ads from mission-aligned brands. Year 4 break-even at risk -- may need more capital. |
| Test 6 fails | Defer corporate matching to Year 2+. Not a launch dependency. |

**The kill criteria:** If Test 1 (concept resonance) and Test 2 (ad-funded engagement) both fail, the core product concept does not have market demand as designed. Stop and rethink before spending $100K+ on engineering. If Tests 2, 3, and 5 all fail (ad engagement low, businesses won't pay, eCPM below projections), the revenue model has no viable path -- the platform may need to reconsider optional premium features or find alternative monetization.

### Phase 0 Budget

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Landing page (Carrd, Webflow, or similar) | $0-50 |
| Paid traffic for A/B tests (Facebook/Instagram) | $600-1,200 |
| Survey tool (Typeform, Google Forms) | $0-35/month |
| Domain + email | $20-50 |
| Local business outreach (printing, travel) | $50-100 |
| Contingency | $200-500 |
| **Total** | **$900-2,000** |

Phase 0 is deliberately cheap. The goal is to spend under $2,000 to learn whether $1M+ in subsequent investment is justified.
