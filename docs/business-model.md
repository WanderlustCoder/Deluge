# Business Model

## Investment Split: 85/15 Default, User-Adjustable

Every dollar invested splits between the user's investment portfolio and community impact projects. No per-transaction fees -- platform costs are covered by subscriptions and ad revenue.

### Default Split: 85/15

| Allocation | Percentage | Example ($10 parcel) |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Investment Account | 85% | $8.50 |
| Impact Projects | 15% | $1.50 |
| Platform Fee | 0% | $0.00 |

**Why 85/15:**
- 85% compounding is defensible as a real wealth-building tool
- 15% to impact is still significant at scale (10,000 users investing $100/month = $150K/month to projects)
- Honest framing: "85 cents of every dollar grows for you"
- Leaves room for users who want to give more

### User-Adjustable Ratios (Paid Tiers)

Paid subscribers can customize their split. Free users get the 85/15 default.

| Split | Investment | Impact | Who it's for |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 90/10 | $9.00 | $1.00 | Primarily investors |
| **85/15 (default)** | **$8.50** | **$1.50** | **Most users -- wealth-first with meaningful impact** |
| 75/25 | $7.50 | $2.50 | Heavier impact emphasis |
| 60/40 | $6.00 | $4.00 | Primarily impact-driven |

Minimum investment ratio: 60%. Maximum: 95%. Users must always have some allocation to both.

---

## Fee Structure: Tiered Subscriptions + Ad Revenue

No per-transaction fees. Revenue comes from subscriptions, ad revenue, and management fees.

### Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0/month | 85/15 fixed split, watch ads to invest, basic portfolio, all community features |
| **Deluge Basic** | $3/month | Adjustable split (75/25 to 90/10), 1.5x ad value multiplier, unlimited manual investments, basic analytics |
| **Deluge Plus** | $5/month | Full split range (60/40 to 95/5), premium portfolio options, advanced impact analytics, priority project access |
| **Deluge Premium** | $12/month | Everything in Plus, family accounts, tax reporting tools, white-glove support, early access to features |

### Ad-Funded Investments

Users can watch video ads to earn real money that gets invested in their account. This makes the platform accessible to users who can't afford to invest cash.

**"Can't invest money? Invest your time instead."**

**How it works:**
1. User watches a 30-second video ad
2. Advertiser pays Deluge (platform earns ad revenue)
3. Deluge credits a portion of the ad revenue to the user's account
4. Credited amount splits at user's ratio (default 85/15)

**Economics per ad view (conservative):**

| Metric | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Advertiser pays Deluge (eCPM) | $8 CPM ($0.008/view) | $15 CPM ($0.015/view) | $25 CPM ($0.025/view) |
| Deluge keeps (platform margin) | 40% ($0.0032) | 40% ($0.006) | 40% ($0.01) |
| Credited to user | 60% ($0.0048) | 60% ($0.009) | 60% ($0.015) |

**Transparency note:** Deluge must clearly disclose how much of the ad revenue reaches the user. "You earned $0.009 from this ad. Deluge kept $0.006 to run the platform." This is the opposite of exploitative models that obscure their economics.

**Caps and controls:**

| Control | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Daily cap | 10 ads per user per day |
| Monthly max earned (base) | ~$2.70/month (10 ads/day x 30 days x $0.009) |
| Streak bonuses (future) | 7-day streak = 1.25x, 30-day = 1.5x |
| Paid tier multiplier | Basic subscribers get 1.5x ad value ($0.0135/view) |
| Anti-fraud | CAPTCHA, pattern detection, device fingerprinting, account verification |

**What this means for users:**

| Usage Pattern | Monthly Earned | Annual Invested (at 85/15) |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Casual (2 ads/day) | $0.54 | $6.48 ($5.51 portfolio + $0.97 impact) |
| Regular (5 ads/day) | $1.35 | $16.20 ($13.77 portfolio + $2.43 impact) |
| Max (10 ads/day) | $2.70 | $32.40 ($27.54 portfolio + $4.86 impact) |

These are small numbers individually. The value is in (a) accessibility for users who have no cash to invest, (b) daily engagement habit, and (c) aggregated ad revenue across thousands of users for the platform.

**What this means for Deluge (platform revenue from ads):**

| Users Watching Ads | Avg Views/Day | Daily Ad Revenue (Deluge's 40%) | Annual |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| 1,000 | 3 | $18 | $6,570 |
| 10,000 | 3 | $180 | $65,700 |
| 50,000 | 3 | $900 | $328,500 |

Ad revenue is a meaningful supplement, not a primary revenue driver. Don't build the business model around it.

---

## All Revenue Streams

### Primary: Subscriptions

| Scenario | Free Users | Paid Conversion | Avg. Monthly Fee |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Conservative | 85% | 5% | $4.50 (weighted avg) |
| Base | 75% | 10% | $5.00 (weighted avg) |
| Optimistic | 65% | 15% | $5.50 (weighted avg) |

Acorns converts roughly 8-12% of signups to paid. Plan around 5-10%.

### Secondary: Ad Revenue

Platform keeps ~40% of ad revenue. The rest is credited to users. At scale this becomes meaningful but it's supplemental revenue, not primary.

### Tertiary: Investment Management Fees (0.25-0.5% of AUM annually)

- Ongoing revenue from invested assets
- Competitive with robo-advisors (Betterment: 0.25%, Wealthfront: 0.25%)
- Compounds as user base and investment balances grow

### Year 2+: B2B Revenue

- Corporate ESG programs: white-label solutions ($10K-50K/year per client)
- Realistic Year 2 target: 2-3 clients, not 5-10
- Institutional partnerships take time to develop -- don't count on them early

### Long-Term (Speculative)

| Stream | Description | When Realistic |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Success fees | Small % when projects hit milestones | Year 2+ |
| Loan repayments | Recycled capital from microloan projects | Year 3+ |
| Equity upside | Small stake in innovation startups | Year 4+ (if ever) |

Do not build financial models that depend on speculative revenue.

## Parcel Breakdown

A "parcel" is a single investment unit. Minimum: $5.

### Example: $10 Cash Investment (Default 85/15 Split)

| Allocation | Amount | What Happens |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Investment Account | $8.50 (85%) | Held in user's name, grows with market returns |
| Impact Projects | $1.50 (15%) | Funds community-proposed project user chose |

No fees deducted from the parcel. Subscription covers platform costs separately.

### Example: Ad-Funded Investment (1 ad view, base scenario)

| Allocation | Amount | What Happens |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Investment Account | $0.00765 (85%) | Added to user's portfolio |
| Impact Projects | $0.00135 (15%) | Added to user's chosen project |

*User earned $0.009 from one ad view. Deluge kept $0.006 of the original $0.015 ad payment.*

**Investment Account:**
- Held via broker-dealer partner (SIPC insured up to $500K)
- Invested in diversified index funds or ESG funds
- User receives market returns
- Platform earns 0.25-0.5% annual management fee

**Impact Projects:**
- User chooses a community-proposed project
- 100% of impact allocation goes to the project (no additional fee)
- Verified impact reporting back to user

---

## Project Tags & Categories

Projects are organized by **tags**, not rigid categories. Tags are flexible labels that help users discover projects. A single project can have multiple tags (e.g., "education" + "local" + "youth" + "Denver").

The community drives what gets funded. Deluge verifies legitimacy and tracks impact, but does not curate or editorialize which projects deserve funding.

### Starter Tags (Platform Launch)

These tags exist from day one as organizing buckets. The community can propose new tags over time.

### 1. Education & Youth Development

- School infrastructure (technology, libraries, labs)
- Scholarship funds
- After-school programs (STEM, arts, tutoring)
- Teacher support and professional development

**Measurable returns:** Graduation rates, test score improvements, college acceptances, employment outcomes, certifications earned.

### 2. Environment & Sustainability

- Land conservation
- Reforestation
- Renewable energy projects
- Clean water initiatives
- Pollution cleanup
- Wildlife protection

**Measurable returns:** Acres protected, carbon sequestered, species recovery, clean energy generated, water quality improvements.

### 3. Innovation & Technology

- Hackerspaces and makerspaces

## Unit Economics

### Per User (Year 1 Assumptions -- Conservative)

**Average cash investment:** $75 total (not $100)
- Initial: $15-25
- Monthly additions: $5
- Many users will try it and invest once or twice, then go dormant
- Some users invest only through ads (no cash)

**Platform revenue per user (blended across all user types):**

| Source | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Subscription revenue (blended) | $2.70/yr | $6.00/yr | $9.90/yr |
| Ad revenue -- platform's 40% cut (avg 2 ads/day across all users) | $1.75/yr | $3.50/yr | $5.84/yr |
| Management fees (0.25% of $75 avg) | $0.19/yr | $0.19/yr | $0.19/yr |
| **Total Year 1 per user** | **$4.64** | **$9.69** | **$15.93** |

*Blended subscription = (% paid users) x (avg monthly fee) x 12.*
*Ad revenue = avg views/day x 365 x eCPM rate x 40% platform cut. Most users watch 0-3 ads/day; blended average ~2/day.*

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**

| Channel | Cost | Reality Check |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Paid ads (Facebook/Instagram) | $15-30 per signup | Fintech industry avg is $20-50 |
| Paid ads (Google) | $25-50 per signup | Competitive keywords |
| Organic/referral | $3-8 per signup | Requires strong word-of-mouth |
| **Blended average** | **$15-25** | Assumes 40% organic, 60% paid |

**Lifetime Value (LTV) -- 3-Year:**

| Scenario | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | 3-Year LTV |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Conservative | $2.89 | $5.50 | $8.00 | $16.39 |
| Base | $6.19 | $12.00 | $18.00 | $36.19 |
| Optimistic | $10.09 | $20.00 | $30.00 | $60.09 |

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**

| Scenario | LTV | CAC | Ratio | Viable? |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|---------|
| Conservative | $16 | $25 | 0.6:1 | No -- need organic growth or lower CAC |
| Base | $36 | $20 | 1.8:1 | Marginal -- needs improvement |
| Optimistic | $60 | $15 | 4:1 | Healthy |

**Key insight:** At conservative estimates, paid acquisition alone doesn't work. Deluge MUST achieve strong organic/viral growth or dramatically lower CAC through content marketing, referrals, and PR to be viable. This is the central economic challenge.

## Financial Projections (5-Year, Three Scenarios)

### User Growth

| Year | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|------|-------------|------|-----------|
| 1 | 3,000 | 8,000 | 15,000 |
| 2 | 10,000 | 30,000 | 60,000 |
| 3 | 25,000 | 75,000 | 150,000 |
| 4 | 50,000 | 150,000 | 300,000 |
| 5 | 80,000 | 250,000 | 500,000 |

### Average Investment Per User

| Year | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|------|-------------|------|-----------|
| 1 | $50 | $75 | $100 |
| 2 | $100 | $150 | $250 |
| 3 | $200 | $350 | $500 |
| 4 | $300 | $500 | $800 |
| 5 | $400 | $700 | $1,000 |

### Year 1 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Subscriptions (800 paid x $5/mo x 12) | $48K |
| Ad revenue -- platform's 40% (8K users x $3.50/yr blended) | $28K |
| Management fees (0.25% of $600K AUM) | $1.5K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$77.5K** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Legal/compliance | $100K |
| Technology (MVP build + ad platform integration) | $170K |
| Marketing | $40K |
| Operations | $30K |
| **Total Costs** | **$340K** |

| **Net** | **-$263K** |
|---------|------------|

Year 1 is an investment year in every scenario. There is no path to Year 1 profitability -- the user base is too small. Ad revenue helps but doesn't change the fundamental math at this scale.

### Year 2 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Subscriptions (3,000 paid x $5/mo x 12) | $180K |
| Ad revenue -- platform's 40% (30K users x $3.75/yr blended) | $113K |
| Management fees (0.25% of $4.5M AUM) | $11K |
| Corporate ESG (2 clients x $15K) | $30K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$334K** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Legal/compliance (ongoing) | $75K |
| Technology (maintenance + features + ad ops) | $150K |
| Marketing | $100K |
| Operations | $60K |
| Team (3 FTE) | $300K |
| **Total Costs** | **$685K** |

| **Net** | **-$351K** |
|---------|------------|

### Year 3 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Subscriptions (7,500 paid x $5.50/mo x 12) | $495K |
| Ad revenue -- platform's 40% (75K users x $4.00/yr blended) | $300K |
| Management fees (0.25% of $26M AUM) | $65K |
| Corporate ESG (5 clients x $25K) | $125K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$985K** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Legal/compliance | $100K |
| Technology (includes ad platform scaling) | $250K |
| Marketing | $200K |
| Operations | $100K |
| Team (8 FTE) | $700K |
| **Total Costs** | **$1.35M** |

| **Net** | **-$365K** |
|---------|------------|

### Year 4 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Subscriptions (15,000 paid x $6/mo x 12) | $1.08M |
| Ad revenue -- platform's 40% (150K users x $4.50/yr blended) | $675K |
| Management fees (0.25% of $75M AUM) | $188K |
| Corporate ESG (10 clients x $35K) | $350K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$2.29M** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| **Total Costs** | **$1.9M** |

| **Net** | **+$390K** (first profitable year) |
|---------|------------|

### Year 5 -- BASE Scenario

| Revenue | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Subscriptions (25,000 paid x $6.50/mo x 12) | $1.95M |
| Ad revenue -- platform's 40% (250K users x $5.00/yr blended) | $1.25M |
| Management fees (0.25% of $175M AUM) | $438K |
| Corporate ESG (15 clients x $40K) | $600K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$4.24M** |

| Costs | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| **Total Costs** | **$2.6M** |

| **Net** | **+$1.64M** |
|---------|------------|

### Cumulative Funding Needed (Base Scenario)

| Through Year | Cumulative Loss | Total Capital Needed |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Year 1 | -$263K | $350K (includes buffer) |
| Year 2 | -$614K | $700K |
| Year 3 | -$979K | $1.1M |
| Year 4 | -$589K | Funded from operations |
| Year 5 | +$1.05M | Profitable |

**Reality check:** With ad revenue included, the base scenario requires approximately **$1-1.3M in total capital** to reach profitability in Year 4 (one year earlier than without ad revenue). This is still not bootstrappable on a small budget, but the capital requirement is more manageable. Ad revenue meaningfully improves the path to profitability at scale, even though per-user ad earnings are modest.

---

## Scenario Summary

| Metric (Year 5) | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|-----------------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Users | 80,000 | 250,000 | 500,000 |
| AUM | $32M | $175M | $500M |
| Annual Revenue (incl. ad revenue) | $740K | $4.2M | $15M |
| Profitable? | No (marginal) | Yes (Year 4) | Yes (Year 3) |
| Total capital needed | $1.5M+ (marginal viability) | $1-1.3M | $750K |

---

## Funding Requirements (Revised)

### Bootstrap Path

| Phase | Funding Source | Amount |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Phase 0 | Self-funded | $2,000-5,000 |
| Phase 1 | Self-funded or friends/family | $100-200K |
| Phase 2 | Angel round (15-25% equity) | $500K-1M |
| Phase 3 | Series A or revenue-funded | $1-3M |

### Venture Path

| Round | Amount | Timing | What It Proves |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Pre-seed | $250-500K | After validation (Phase 0) | People want this |
| Seed | $1-2M | After MVP + 1,000 users | Product works |
| Series A | $5-10M | After 30K+ users, clear retention | Business works |

### Total to Launch (Revised, Honest)

| Phase | Cost | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Phase 0 (Validation) | $2,000-5,000 | Landing page, ads, survey |
| Phase 1 (Legal + Partnerships) | $100,000-200,000 | Securities lawyer, broker-dealer integration, entity formation |
| Phase 2 (MVP Build) | $150,000-300,000 | Engineering, design, QA, broker integration |
| Phase 3 (Launch + Runway) | $200,000-500,000 | Marketing, team, 6-12 month runway |
| **Total to Launch + Survive Year 1** | **$450K-1M** |

The original $100-200K estimate was unrealistic for a regulated fintech product. Most investment platforms spend $500K-2M before their first paying user.

---

## Key Assumptions to Validate in Phase 0

These are the make-or-break questions. If any answer is "no," the model needs to change.

1. **Will people accept the 85/15 default split?** (15% of their money goes to impact instead of compounding)
2. **Will users watch ads to earn investment credit?** (Is "invest your time" compelling or does it feel exploitative?)
3. **Will people pay $3-12/month for this?** (Or do they expect it to be free like Robinhood?)
4. **Is the CAC achievable below $20?** (If not, unit economics don't work)
5. **Can we retain 30%+ MAU after Month 3?** (Most apps lose 70-80% of users in 90 days)
6. **Can we find a broker-dealer willing to partner at our scale?** (Many require minimums)
7. **Can we achieve $8-15 eCPM consistently?** (Ad rates fluctuate seasonally and by market conditions)
