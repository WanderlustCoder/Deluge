# Go-to-Market Strategy

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Timeline | Focus | Cost (Realistic) |
|-------|----------|-------|------------------|
| Phase 0 | Months 1-3 | Validation | $900-2,000 |
| Phase 1 | Months 4-8 | Legal & Partnerships | $30-70,000 |
| Phase 2 | Months 8-14 | MVP Build & Beta | $100-250,000 |
| Phase 3 | Months 14-20 | Public Launch | $150-350,000 |
| Phase 4 | Years 3-5 | Growth & Scale | Variable |

**Total to first paying user (realistic): $280K-675K.**
Without investment/brokerage infrastructure, Deluge avoids the regulatory complexity and cost of securities compliance. Legal setup is limited to entity formation, money transmission classification, and charitable solicitation review -- dramatically cheaper and faster than the fintech path.

---

## Phase 0: Validation (Months 1-3)

**Objective:** Prove (or disprove) that real humans would actually use this platform. Keep working the current job -- this is nights and weekends.

### 1. Landing Page

- Build on deluge.fund
- Hero: cascade video animation
- Email capture
- Survey link (5 questions about interest, amount, categories)
- Tools: Carrd, Webflow, or Squarespace
- Budget: $100-200

**Landing page structure:**

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Above the fold | "Deluge: One by One, All at Once" + "Fund your community. No money required." + CTA: "Join the Waitlist" |
| How It Works | 3-step visual: Contribute (cash, ads, or time) / Choose your projects / Track real impact |
| Impact Categories | Visual cards for Education, Environment, Innovation |
| Real Impact | "100% of your cash contribution goes to your watershed. Watch ads or browse local businesses to fund projects directly." |
| Social Proof | Waitlist count, persona-style quotes |
| Final CTA | Email signup + optional survey |

### 2. Validation Survey (5-7 questions)

1. How much would you contribute per month? ($0 / $1-5 / $5-10 / $10-25 / $25+)
2. Which impact categories matter most? (rank: Education, Environment, Innovation, Health, Housing, Arts, Workforce)
3. What would make you trust this platform? (transparency / third-party audits / known partners / user reviews)
4. How often would you check your impact? (daily / weekly / monthly / rarely)
5. Would you watch 3-5 ads/day to fund community projects at no cost to you? (yes / no / maybe)
6. Would you watch ads to fund projects if it cost you nothing? (yes / no / maybe)
7. Email address (for waitlist)

Tools: Typeform or Google Forms. Budget: $0-25.

### 3. Paid Advertising ($500-1,000 budget)

**Platform:** Facebook/Instagram

**Target audience:**
- Age: 25-45
- Interests: community giving, sustainability, social entrepreneurship, crowdfunding platforms, charitable giving
- Locations: US (urban/suburban focus)

**Ad creative (A/B test):**

| Variant | Copy |
|---------|------|
| A | "What if watching an ad could fund a community garden?" |
| B | "Fund real community projects -- with cash, ads, or your time. One app." |
| C | "Your neighbors are funding local projects. Join them." |
| D | "Deluge: One by One, All at Once" with cascade imagery |

**Goal:** 300-500 email signups. Expect $3-8 per signup (not $1-2 -- social impact audiences are expensive to reach). The point of Phase 0 is learning, not scale. Even 200 quality signups with survey data is valuable.

### 4. Organic Outreach

- Post in Reddit: r/personalfinance, r/SocialEntrepreneurship, r/nonprofit
- LinkedIn posts (personal + professional network)
- Twitter thread explaining concept
- Medium article: "Why Community Giving Needs Gamification"

### 5. Identify Nonprofit Partners

- Find 10-15 potential partners across Education, Environment, Innovation
- Research via GuideStar, local foundations, national orgs with local chapters
- Create spreadsheet: org name, contact, category, project ideas, 990 filings
- Don't reach out yet -- wait until validation is complete

### 6. Expert Interviews

- Talk to fintech founders
- Talk to community giving and nonprofit professionals
- Talk to nonprofit leaders
- Validate assumptions, refine the model

### Decision Gate 1

| Criteria | Target | Minimum Viable |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Email signups | 500+ | 200 |
| Cost per signup (paid) | <$5 | <$10 |
| Survey: would contribute $5+ | 60%+ | 40%+ |
| Survey: would watch ads to fund projects | 70%+ | 50%+ |
| Survey completion rate | 50%+ | 30%+ |
| Organic interest (shares, comments, DMs) | Qualitative | Any signal |

**GO:** Proceed to Phase 1. Minimum viable signals met across most criteria.
**ITERATE:** Mixed results. Refine positioning, test different messaging or audience, run another $500 in ads.
**NO-GO:** Weak across all criteria. Pivot the concept or table the idea. This outcome is valuable -- it saved $500K+ of wasted effort.

---

## Phase 1: Legal & Partnerships (Months 4-8)

**Objective:** Establish the legal entity, secure payment processing, and finalize nonprofit partnerships. Without securities regulation, this phase is significantly shorter and cheaper.

### 1. Legal Structure ($30-70K)

- Hire fintech/compliance lawyer (not securities lawyer -- no brokerage)
- Form Deluge Fund PBC
- Determine money transmission classification (state-by-state analysis)
- Charitable solicitation registration (varies by state)
- Draft Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- Address gamification-of-giving concerns proactively

**Key questions for lawyer:**
- Does the watershed model constitute money transmission? Which states require MTL?
- What charitable solicitation registrations are needed?
- How do gamification features (badges, leaderboards) affect our regulatory exposure?
- What is the simplest compliant structure?
- What are ongoing annual compliance costs? (Budget $15-30K/year ongoing)

**Reality check:** Initial legal consultation is $3-5K. Full legal setup (entity formation, MTL analysis, charitable solicitation, ToS, privacy policy) is $30-70K. Ongoing compliance is $15-30K/year. Dramatically cheaper than the securities-regulated path.

### 2. Nonprofit Partnerships (3-5 organizations)

- Formal partnership agreements
- Establish project vetting process
- Define impact measurement standards
- Agree on fee structure
- Co-marketing agreements

**Target partners per category:**
- Education: 2-3 (local school foundations, DonorsChoose, scholarship funds)
- Environment: 2-3 (local land trusts, Nature Conservancy chapter, conservation orgs)
- Innovation: 1-2 (makerspaces, STEM nonprofits)

### 3. Begin MVP Scoping

- Identify lead engineer or development agency
- Define absolute minimum feature set:
  - Sign up, profile
  - Browse projects (**1 category** to start -- prove the core loop)
  - Contribute cash (Stripe integration)
  - Watch ads to fund projects (ad mediation integration)
  - Dashboard (watershed balance + impact metrics)
  - No gamification in V1 -- badges and leaderboards come after core is proven
- Get quotes and timeline estimates ($100-250K range expected)

**Note:** Full MVP development belongs in Phase 2. Phase 1 is about legal and partnership readiness. Do not start building until the regulatory path is clear.

### Decision Gate 2

| Criteria | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Legal entity established | PBC formed, compliant |
| Money transmission pathway clear | Lawyer confirms approach |
| Payment processing | Stripe integration confirmed |
| Nonprofit partners | 3-5 with 5-10 projects ready |
| Development plan | Scoped, quoted, team identified |
| Funding secured | $200K+ available for Phase 2 |

**GO:** Begin MVP build (Phase 2).
**NO-GO:** Legal or partnership blockers exist. Reassess structure or pivot.

---

## Phase 2: MVP Build & Beta (Months 8-14)

**Objective:** Build the minimum viable product, integrate payment processing and ad network, beta test with 100 users.

### 1. MVP Development ($100-250K)

- Web app (React) -- mobile comes later
- True minimum features:
  - Sign up, profile
  - Browse and fund projects (1-2 categories)
  - Cash contributions via Stripe
  - Watch ads to fund projects (AdMob integration)
  - Dashboard showing watershed balance + impact metrics
  - Business listing billing (Stripe)
- No gamification, no social features, no leaderboards in V1

### 2. Beta Testing

- Recruit 50-100 users from email waitlist
- Closed beta (invite-only)
- Focus on: Does the core contribution + impact loop work? Do people come back?
- Key metric: Do beta users make a second contribution within 30 days?
- Iterate based on feedback

### Decision Gate 2.5

| Criteria | Target | Minimum Viable |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Beta users active after 30 days | 50%+ | 30%+ |
| Second contribution made | 40%+ of users | 20%+ |
| NPS score | >40 | >20 |
| Core loop functional | No critical bugs | Stable |
| Ad-watching willingness | 70%+ would watch ads to fund projects | 50%+ |

**GO:** Public launch (Phase 3).
**ITERATE:** Core works but needs refinement. Extend beta.
**NO-GO:** Users don't come back or won't pay. Major pivot needed.

---

## Phase 3: Public Launch (Months 14-20)

**Objective:** Launch publicly, acquire first 1,000-5,000 users, fund first 3-5 projects. Note: 10,000 users in the first months is aggressive -- 1,000-5,000 is more realistic for a new community giving platform.

### 1. Launch Event

- Demo the platform live
- Introduce nonprofit partners
- Q&A session
- Invite press

### 2. PR Push

- Press release distribution

- Exclusive early access
- Incentive: "First 1,000 get Founder badge"

### 5. Community Building

- Launch Discord or Slack community
- Weekly AMAs
- Showcase projects
- Celebrate cascades publicly

### Decision Gate 3

| Criteria | Target | Minimum Viable |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Users (6 months) | 5,000 | 1,000 |
| Total contributed | $250K+ | $50K+ |
| Business listings (enhanced) | 20-30% of listed businesses | 10%+ |
| Projects fully funded | 2-3 | 1 |
| Press coverage | 2+ articles | 1 |
| Monthly Active Users | 35%+ | 25%+ |
| Retention (30-day) | 30%+ | 20%+ |

## Decision Framework

If validation is **weak** at any gate:

**Possible pivots:**
- Different target audience
- Narrower focus (fewer categories)
- B2B only (corporate ESG tool)
- Different business model

**Or gracefully exit:**
- Document learnings
- Table the idea for later
- Revisit when market is ready
- No shame -- validation saved years of wasted effort

| Product vision | Nonprofit relationships |
| Project management | Marketing/growth leadership |

---

## Risk Analysis

### Regulatory Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Money transmission classification | Legal analysis before launch; architecture supports MTL or exemption path; start in favorable states |
| Charitable solicitation compliance | State-by-state registration plan; budget for compliance across initial launch states |

### Market Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Another platform adds similar giving features | More options for givers is a net positive; Deluge's depth in community-driven giving with full transparency is its distinctive value; PBC mission lock ensures long-term alignment |
| Economic downturn reduces giving appetite | Free-tier pathways (ads, browsing) unaffected; community engagement maintains participation; free-tier model means zero barrier to continued participation |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Nonprofit partner fails or has scandal | Rigorous vetting; third-party verification; regular audits; insurance/reserves |
| Platform fraud or hacking | SOC 2 compliance; insurance; regular penetration testing; encrypted payment processing |

### Financial Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Burn through funding before profitability | Bootstrap early; clear milestone-gated funding; conservative projections; multiple revenue streams |
| Poor unit economics (CAC too high) | Viral/referral mechanics; organic growth focus; test channels cheaply; optimize before scaling |

## The Giving Ecosystem

### How Deluge Complements Existing Platforms

The giving ecosystem is rich with platforms that serve givers in different ways. Deluge does not replace any of them -- it adds a new option focused on collective, community-driven giving with full transparency.

| Platform | What They Do Well | How Deluge Complements |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| GoFundMe | Empowers individuals to rally support for personal and community needs at massive scale | Deluge adds ongoing collective giving with community aggregation, recurring engagement, and progress tracking |
| DonorsChoose | Connects donors directly to classroom projects with clear accountability | Deluge extends the direct-to-project model across all impact categories with free-tier pathways and microloans |
| Kiva | Pioneered accessible microloans that recycle capital for continuous impact | Deluge combines microloan recycling with grant funding, ad-funded giving, and community watershed tracking |
| Charity Navigator | Helps donors make informed decisions about where to give | Deluge builds on the transparency standard with real-time project tracking and community-level impact metrics |
| Patreon | Enables sustainable recurring support for creators | Deluge applies recurring support to community projects with collective impact measurement |
| GiveDirectly | Delivers direct cash transfers with rigorous evidence | Deluge offers community-chosen project variety alongside direct giving pathways |
| Change.org | Mobilizes communities around shared causes | Deluge channels community momentum into funded action with measurable outcomes |

### What Deluge Adds to the Ecosystem

Deluge brings a distinctive combination to the giving landscape:
1. **Zero-barrier entry** -- fund projects with $0 through ads and browsing
2. **Transparent impact** -- specific projects, real updates, full visibility into fund flow
3. **Engaging progress tracking** -- badges, community milestones, collective impact
4. **Recycled capital** -- microloans that come back and get redeployed
