# Deluge

**One by One, All at Once.**

Deluge is a community-driven investment platform where people come together to fund the projects and causes they believe in. Users invest as little as $5 to grow their wealth through market returns while directing impact dollars to community-proposed projects -- then track both their financial returns and real-world outcomes in one app.

## The Vision

Every great change starts small. A single raindrop falls on a mountaintop. Then another. They gather into streams, creeks, rivers -- until all at once, the cascade arrives. Unstoppable. Transformative. Beautiful.

That is how Deluge works. One by one, people join because something speaks to them. Education. Environment. Innovation. Their passion. Then others see and join. Until suddenly -- all at once -- there is critical mass. The dam breaks. Millions in capital flow toward humanity's biggest challenges.

## How It Works

1. **Invest as little as $5** -- choose a "parcel" amount
2. **Money splits cleanly** -- 85% into your investment portfolio, 15% into impact projects (no per-transaction fee). Paid subscribers can adjust their ratio.
3. **Or invest your time** -- watch ads to earn real investment credit, even with $0 cash
4. **Flat monthly subscription** -- $0/3/5/12 per month covers platform costs (like Acorns)
4. **Find your community** -- join communities around causes, locations, or interests you care about
5. **Fund community-proposed projects** -- anyone can propose a project; the community decides what gets funded
6. **Rally behind what matters** -- share, promote, and build momentum for the projects you believe in
7. **Track everything** -- watch your wealth grow AND see the real-world outcomes of projects your community funded
8. **Earn achievements** -- badges, leaderboards, and collections make investing engaging

## The Manifesto

> A single raindrop seems insignificant. Fragile. Easy to ignore.
>
> But raindrops don't stay alone.
>
> They gather. On mountaintops. In valleys. Across entire watersheds.
>
> One by one, they find each other. Join together. Build momentum.
>
> A trickle becomes a stream. A stream becomes a creek. A creek becomes a river.
>
> And then, all at once, the cascade.
>
> Unstoppable. Transformative. Beautiful.
>
> This is how change happens. Not through grand gestures by the powerful few, but through small acts by the committed many.
>
> Your $5 is a raindrop. Your choice is where it falls. Your impact is what happens when it joins the flow.
>
> Education. Environment. Innovation. Community.
>
> Pick your mountain. Be the drop. Join the cascade.
>
> Because one by one, all at once, we become the deluge that changes everything.
